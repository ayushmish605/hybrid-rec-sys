3,imdb,fciocca,6.0,"6 / 10 A sick movie, plenty of explicit violence. An interesting production for horror fans. ""The Sadness"" is one of the most violent and sickest films that I watched in 2023. The setup is interesting and the ""zombies"" are not the usual mindless and slow monsters roaming around. They are really dangerous because the virus does not inhibit their brain and it actually strengthens their violence. Moreover, the makeup was top notch and they looked truly scary. I liked the fact that there was some kind of villain that was chasing down one of the main characters. The danger felt closer and more personal and it added a captivating layer to the story. However, the script is pretty basic and plot wise there is really nothing peculiar. The acting was just okay and none of the performances could really grab my attention. The dialogues are lazy and after a while it just gets boring hearing vulgarities from these monsters. I mean, I get it, whoever is infected becomes extremely depraved; there is no need to reiterate the concept for one hour and a half. I have watched many incredibly twisted scenes in my life, but in this specific case there were some things that were really difficult to stand. For sure it is not a film for families or for people with a weak stomach. The practical effects are well done and the attack scenes are directed competently. I believe that this film will make happy body horror fans. My final mark is in line with the average: 6.5 stars out of 10.",2023-08-28,0,0,264,-0.9633,negative,0.748,
3,imdb,heretic369,6.0,"6 / 10 ""The crossed"" in asian version What is the human without constraints? A monster.. In ""the sadness"" a virus mutation transforms the infected! - this has nothing to do with zombies, nothing at all - into such unregulated creatures. For fans of ""the crossed"" from Garth Ennis, this will be quite known territory. Although where Crossed can show this happening at a broader scale ""the sadness"" always seems quite limited. Even though there are a few nice Splatter scenes and especially the beginning is quite atmospheric, the more the movie nears it´s -predictable- ending, the less is actually happening. Six points for the bravery to actually try this kind of stuff. Could have been much better though.",2022-02-03,0,0,119,-0.3788,negative,0.846,

3,imdb,Arshia_mostafavi,7.0,"7 / 10 ""An Extremity That Justifies Itself"" Yes, this is exactly the best way to describe it. I don't know if the director intentionally aimed to weave deep psychological themes into the film, or if it was just to make a name. But I do know that the film carries a heavy tension between ethics and human desire throughout. It's a film with little unnecessary dialogue-almost 90% of the conversations have meaning, delivering the film's core message. In the most colloquial terms, the film's theme can be summed up as: ""They're aware, but the pleasure feels inevitable-as if you're telling them not to blink."" A film that reflects the endlessness of human desire. A film that acts like a warning. A film that says the only thing keeping us from total collapse is that thin thread of awareness about ethics. One of the most interesting and heartbreaking aspects is that it's not a virus that turns you into someone else, or a zombie, or anything like that. It's still you-completely you-who transforms from a victim into a full-blown maniac with no boundaries or rules. And in the final scene, where the director builds the story's climax in the very last moments, when even the protagonist is not spared from the madness, and the tears and pain turn into tears of twisted pleasure- you hope for a happy ending, but the director keeps you suspended in a surreal state at every moment- a surrealism rooted in realism.",2025-04-28,0,0,247,0.027,neutral,0.73,
3,imdb,JayDeeezy,6.0,"6 / 10 Pseudo-allegory This is a hot one right now. It promises violence and definitely delivers on that front. Some, however, are praising it for its commentary on the COVID pandemic but I found its messages to be pretty thin. I think there was potential for a profound allegory but it merely toys at one here and there and then remembers what it is - a nihilistic gorefest. I will say it has great production value and some very memorable shots. It will appease the twisted side of the hardcore horror fan - it superficially prioritizes shock value and I suppose it's worth a viewing out of pure curiosity. In the end though, I didn't find it to be too special in the grand scheme of zombie/Crazies-type films.",2022-05-20,0,0,129,0.9765,positive,0.701,

3,imdb,paul_m_haakonsen,6.0,"6 / 10 Gory and brutal, but not an outstanding horror movie... Now I read somewhere online that someone had written something in the likes of ""if you're just going to watch one zombie movie this year, make it this one"". And that made me actually take notice of the 2021 Taiwanese horror movie ""Ku Bei"" (aka ""The Sadness""). I had initially skipped it back in 2021, and then sought it out here in 2022, as I read that praise of the movie. So it was with some expectation that I sat down to watch what writer and director Rob Jabbaz had to offer with ""Ku Bei"". And I will say that it was watchable, for sure, but it just wasn't all that fantastic or outstanding. And the ""if you're just going to watch..."" sentence hardly rang true for ""Ku Bei"". As a matter of fact, then ""Ku Bei"" felt like a Taiwanese tribute to the 2002 movie ""28 Days Later"", as there were massive similarities. And as for ""Ku Bei"" being a zombie movie. No. It is not a zombie movie. Very much similar to ""28 Days Later"", ""Ku Bei"" is a movie about people getting affected with some sickness that makes them into raging lunatics that also have cannibalistic and sexual deviant tendencies. I wasn't familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, but then again I am not well-traversed in the Taiwanese cinema. The good part about ""Ku Bei"" was the gore and mayhem. This movie was bloody, so very, very bloody. In fact, at times it was just too much. There was a scene where there literally was a fountain of blood spraying from the neck of someone. I have to say that I was good and ready to turn the movie off at that time, because it was just infantile stupid. But I opted to stick with the movie and give writer and director Rob Jabbaz a proper chance. The effects in ""Ku Bei"" were good. There was a ton of blood and gore, which I enjoyed. And I have to say that the effects looked realistic, and it added a lot of enjoyment to the movie. So thumbs up to the special effects department for this accomplishment. ""Ku Bei"" is watchable, as I mentioned earlier, but it is by no means a revolutionary movie in the horror genre. Sure, I enjoyed the mayhem, gore and visceral brutality in the movie. I am a life-long gorehound after all. However, I doubt that I will ever return to watch ""Ku Bei"" a second time, simply as the storyline just doesn't have enough depth or contents to support a second viewing. Personally, I think the whole sexual deviant aspect to the infection in the movie was unnecessary, and it just added a level of sleaze to the movie that held it back somewhat. And there were some scenes in the movie that also were unnecessary to include on that account. But hey, a matter of personal preference, I suppose. But if you are a true hentai - go for it. My rating of ""Ku Bei"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",2022-05-21,0,0,526,0.3941,positive,0.77,

3,imdb,H1DEK1,6.0,"6 / 10 Amazing gore but weak on script The introductory part of the film is weak and not enough information is given to us to get to know the characters. Things are happening fast. There are problems with the script in general, and there are also some problems with the flow of the film. There are several unexplained parts in the film. How does one of them spread the virus?.. The make-up is quite successful, but when gore is used a lot, it doesn't seem very disturbing and impressive to the viewer after a while. The acting of the leading girl and the boy is not good enough and they cannot come to the fore. The pervert on the subway is the most prominent character in my opinion.

Maybe if it wasn't soooo much it would have been ok but every instance of violence or cool kill has a moment where things just get way too dark and weird. It's unsettling and instead of going for scares and impressive visuals movies like this just want you to see the most depraved things they can think of and again, while I'm sure the Hostel, Human Centipede fans out there will love this movie, it just doesn't work for me.",2022-12-24,0,0,125,0.9001,positive,0.66,
3,imdb,manuelasaez,8.0,"8 / 10 As extreme and disturbing as everyone said it was going to be There are few movies that push the envelope so much that you wonder how they were even able to be released. Movies like Martyrs, Irreversible, Inside ect. Are all films that make you wonder ""How did anyone come up with such a twisted film and how did it ever get released?"". This is one of those movies. In fact, this movie takes it one step further; it actually shows you everything that can go wrong if your basic violent instinct were left unchecked. It's a raw, gritty, over the top spectacle that that never lets you forget that this is just a movie and things like this can't really happen, right? RIGHT?!?! Things kick off almost as soon as the movie begins, and they really don't let up throughout. You have every single extreme horror trope thrown in here, everything you could possibly see in your average horror movie can be found here; dismemberment, blood, carnage, evisceration, a bloody orgy. I mean, the only thing it doesn't show is the more extreme stuff that no one wants to see anyway and that never warrants a mention, but for true gore hounds and fans of movie such as those from the French Extremity, this is right up your alley. The acting is great, the effects are realistic and comically well done and excessive, and the movie is just a truly entertaining watch from beginning to end. You know it's going to end in a messed up way but you watch anyway, simply because everyone put their true heart and soul into this film. The SFX crew in particular should be commended at creating some of the best facial deformities I have ever seen. During some scenes, I literally said, ""How the hell did they do THAT?!?"". Many people have been comparing this film to the comic book series ""CROSSED"" and I can see where the similarities can be found. But let's be real, folks; half the stuff in Crossed could NEVER be used in a movie, and this film is tame compared to some of the truly twisted and sick things that happened in that comic book. I loved every minute of this film, and although it's nasty and extreme and vulgar, it never lets you forget that despite all that, it's just a movie. Most people won't like it, and deservedly so. But for those of us who do enjoy this type of film, it's one of the rare ones that truly lives up to the hype. I was thoroughly impressed in every possible way with this movie, but I deducted 2 stars simply because I felt it could have gone further. Perhaps an uncut version will be released down the line and make me eat my words. Fingers CROSSED!!!! (Get it?!?!)",2022-04-10,0,0,477,0.9908,positive,0.798,

3,imdb,redtiago,5.0,"5 / 10 Depraved, violent, blood everywere, weak script I saw Friday at MotelX It is being commercially promoted, i think not from the director he only wanted to make a film appealing to the most ""harcore"" fans of the genre, as innovator, with a new variant of zombies. With human beings alive but infected by a virus that attacks the brain, causing them to behave without being able to repress the most basic instincts of violence and sex. It's an idea that I like as a premise for a horror film, but it's not at all new, ""The Crazies"" direted in 1973 by Master George A. Romero had this premise and this one in my opinion is a a much better movie, well done and with a much better script. ""The Sadness"" is more violent and depraved, but the plot is very basic and then it's just gore, liters and liters of blood, sometimes well executed, sometimes not, clearly noticing the rubber. As a fan of ""hardcore"" horror, i liked this rampant slaughter, but I have to be honest and admit that it's just an average movie, very well promoted, albeit wrongly, as an innovator, one of the most violent and depraved ever. There are far better Asian zombie movies like the much-recognized ""Train do Busain"" or the lesser-known but high-quality Chinese saga ""the way home"". This one is clearly not in that league.

3,imdb,j_movie,7.0,"7 / 10 some feelings Online viewing of Locarno Film Festival. This film has really wanted to see for a long time. Together with ""Curse"" and ""psychic medium"", it has become the most anticipated Asian horror film of the three major years for fans. Actually, the impression after reading is general, and there may have been enough psychological expectations, so the presentation of plasma and violence is still acceptable. But the plot is really much weaker than expected. In the end, I didn't fully understand the way the virus spread. Moreover, it is not a zombie film. The infected people in the film still retain human consciousness and thinking, and even can speak normally. Only the most violent and dirty side of the body is stimulated, just like people have to blink, they can't control it at all. This is probably why the director said that this film wants to highlight the ""evil"" side of human nature. With the epidemic situation as a big environment worth pondering, we can probably understand what the director wants to express. However, compared with Busan, it also presents the evil of human nature in an extreme environment, and the characterization is much worse. There is even no character emotion at all, which naturally becomes a simple class B film. However, we can still see the director trying to add some caution to some scenes, such as the audience who still don't forget to take out their mobile phones to shoot even though there is a river of blood on the subway, such as the president who talks and gives history lessons to panicked people but can't take effective action, such as the doctor who thinks he is just and dignified but experiments with babies... Of course, these people have no good end, The director may also want to use this way to make some of his own voice.

As others surely have pointed out, the idea is not new. And you won't really see too much of a story here. Actually you may wonder if what we learn from the relationship that our two leads have, was in any way essential or necessary. But before the mayhem begins, it is always nice to have some ... well quiet time. Also the beginning clearly is a statement - to all the conspiracy theories and to how the world has gone mad. Quite a few stabs at things going wrong - politically but also socially speaking. That is not the only thing you get though. Apart from the overall plot being lifted from something like The Crazies by Romero, you also have homages to a lot of other scenes from many different movies. Irreversible, Night of the Living Dead, Serbian Film and so forth ... I reckon a second viewing would reveal even more to me.

While not quite as well made as South Korean movies like Train to Busan (2016) or I Saw The Devil (2010) , The Sadness is still jammed pack with bloody violent scenes and some sexual perversion.

3,imdb,eddie_baggins,5.0,"5 / 10 High-end gore with no substance Creating quite the stir with his debut effort behind the camera, Canadian born but Taiwan based director Rob Jabbaz's visceral and uncompromising gore-filled horror The Sadness never shy's away from its depraved and wild set-up but while it's sure to shock and keep you watching (if your stomach allows it), there's a coldness and narrative void here the film can't overcome, halting it from becoming the must-watch genre experience of the year. Gaining notoriety at various festivals across the world and garnering larger hype after its release recently on horror streaming service Shudder, The Sadness has managed to draw viewers in through attention in the press and word of mouth occurrences and for anyone that is expecting a bloodthirsty escapade that explores the city of Taipei thrown into chaos when a plague turns many of its citizens into murderous and raving lunatics, Jabbaz film will provide the exact type of offering their seeking but it's unfortunate the central characters and plot-line don't connect to make all the insanity something more than pure shock value. Wasting little time getting stuck into the action (horror) of his film, deep fried goodness included, Jabbaz tries to give his film some heart and soul with Berant Zhu and Regina Lei's loved up couple Jim and Katie becoming our hosts in amongst the depravity of the Taiwanese plague but despite the best attempts of his lead duo, their quest to be reunited in the chaos unfolding around them never really clicks into gear, making much of The Sadness's plot paper thin at best and with little reason to care about outcomes of the films characters, there's only so far this feature can go on the back of its sensory overload. There's little denying in this sensory sense that The Sadness is one of the most unforgettable and eye opening genre efforts in some time and Jabbaz does instil this affair with a sense of kinetic energy that captures the insanity and wild nature of this premise, that while over the top in almost all instances, strikes a different kind of chord after the Covid-19 era of our lives and while it's not an entirely unique premise, with the film feeling like a zombie film that isn't while touches on familiar ground to a film such as The Crazies, there is a unique and memorable nature to this film that is found amongst all the lesser elements. Final Say - A film that may be too much for many to handle, The Sadness never holds back when it comes to the shock and awe factor of its story but with an inability to make us care and a faltering in the storytelling department, this blood-soaked horror is never close to being the classic it might have been. 2 1/2 umbrellas out of 5.

It's absolutely wild and I loved it so much. It's utterly disturbing too with some of the things it does. Just when you think it can't get anymore disturbing it ups that completely. It's fast paced, as soon as everything hits it just gets outrageous and it is brilliant. With it being full pedal to the metal and being incredibly stressful and tense. There's a moment it slows down and it's good to have this moment so you can have a breather before we get pulled back in and punched straight in the face with the extreme scenes and buckets of blood. The Sadness does have many horrific scenes and it's some of the most shocking stuff I've seen in some time.

Unfortunately the film loses its way as soon as the two protagonists reach the hospital and from there on in it descends into a miasma of chop, slash and random blood spatter, mixed with some truly gruesome and to many people, highly offensive rape scenes, which spoiled what was an excellent start to a new zombie-crazies style pandemic end of world scenario which I am a big fan of. Undoubtedly the Asians are now the master of the Zombie end of days genre, with the West losing its way with TWD and just about any other new zombie-pandemic rubbish they come out with and this film, even though it lost its direction half way through, still beats most of the Hollywood nonsense into a cocked hat, so I am giving this one a very fair above average 6 hatchets out of 10 on this one!",2022-05-19,0,0,228,-0.8754,negative,0.802,

I get the pandemic storyline, I love the wall-to-wall gore effects and emphasis on practical mayhem, but other than that, this is an entirely hollow experience. The acting is wonky at best and the characterisation rings totally hollow. The attempts at social commentary are heavy handed at best. Worst of all is the gross-out humour, which takes things far too far and leads to this being mean-spirited and unappealing. What I was hoping for was something more like Korea's fine PROJECT WOLF HUNTING, which has the same level of bloodshed but also delivers a thrilling story at the same time.

2,imdb,bankofmarquis,8.0,"8 / 10 Strong Satirical look at the Afghanistan conflict One of the reasons that I write reviews of movies is that I hope to turn people on to good movies that might otherwise fly under their radar. Such is my hope with Tina Fey's latest film WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT - a satirical view of the conflict in Afghanistan as seen through the eyes of a novice International reporter (Fey). What starts out as a funny and corny ""fish out of water"" movie, slowly morphs into a more serious film about the addictive nature of constantly being in a warzone situation. Fey is perfectly cast as the central character - war correspondent Kim Baker - who heads to an overseas assignment in Afghanistan to escape a rather humdrum life. I was a little nervous, at first, as all the funny parts that were in the trailer were in the first 1/2 hour of this film - and Fey handles those with aplomb. She is a gifted comedienne, so these scenes looked effortless for her. It is her transition to a more serious reporter, addicted to the adrenaline of her job that Fey really shines. I was impressed with her serious work in THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU and was anxious when it looked like her career regressed with last December's SISTERS, but I'm happy to say she continues to grow as an actress and she is strong in this part. But, this movie is more than just Fey. She has a very strong supporting cast around her - Martin Freeman as an Irish photographer, Margot Robbie (who continues to grow as an actress) as a friend/journalist competitor to Fey, Alfred Molina as an Afghanistan politician and newcomer (at least to me) Christoper Abbott as Fey's interpreter - they all bring something interesting to the table that helps this movie along. Special mention should be made of Billy Bob Thornton's General Hollander - the US Commander in the region. While he does not have many scenes in the movie, he brings a presence that is heads and shoulders above everyone else when he is on screen. This fits well in this movie, for the Commanding General in that region should be heads and shoulders above the rest. He also gave me the best laugh in this movie (a joke I will not spoil here). This movie is much, much more than a simple rom-com or military comedy, it is a Comedy/Drama that brings quite a bit of heart to it. I would strongly encourage you to seek this one out, you'll be glad you did. 8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to Bank (of Marquis)",2016-03-07,0,0,449,0.9976,positive,0.801,
2,imdb,paul-allaer,8.0,"8 / 10 WTF, shouldered by Tina Fay, is NOT a comedy ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (2016 release; 111 min.) brings the story (""Based on a True Story"" we are reminded) of Kim Baker (played by Tina Fay.. As the movie opens, we see Baker in a heated argument with an Afghani man. Then we go ""Two Years Earlier"", where Baker, looking miserable, is in a team meeting for some news outfit. When told that there is a shortage of TV journalists in Afghanistan, Baker does not hesitate, and she volunteers, supposedly for a three month assignment. Next thing, we see Baker arrive at the Kabul Airport. At this point we are at most 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of the book ""The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" by real-life TV reporter Kim Barker (not sure why in the movie the names becomes ""Baker""). The movie is the latest for directing team Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who previously brought us ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""Focus"", among others. Here, they, along with producers Lorne ""SNL"" Michaels and Tina Fay herself, try to give us a glimpse of what it was like for an inexperienced journalist to come to Afghanistan in 2003 and report on the war. The early past of the movie shows us how Baker is adjusting to her new environment, and what a shock to the system it is indeed. Along the way we get to know fellow journalist Tanya Vanderpoel, (played by up-and-coming Australian actress Margot Robbie who also was in ""Focus""). But the movie really takes off in the second hour (no worries, I won't spoil). Incredibly, Google Movie Times bills this as a 'comedy', and IMDb categorizes it as ""Comedy, War"". Please note: this is NOT a comedy. If you are going to see this, expecting many laugh-out-loud moments as only Tina Fey the comedian can bring them you are going to be sorely disappointed and let down. Sure, there are a few good chuckles early on as Baker/Fey adjusts to life in Afghanistan, but that's it. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a journalistic war drama, period. Not sure whether it is the producers or the studio who are pushing this as a 'comedy' but that is a grave mistake. Besides Fey and Robbie, there are many other fine performances, including Billy Bob Thornton in a small role as a Marine Corps General. Last but bot least, there is a lot of great music in the film, including the original score, courtesy of Nick ""DeVotchKa"" Urata, and also a bunch of song placements, such as Radiohead's ""Nude"", the National's ""Green Gloves"" and Harry Nillson's ""Without You"", which I will never listen to the same way again, seeing how it was used in this movie. Bottom line: ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a fine movie, shouldered by Tina Fey NOT being funny. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" was released nationwide this weekend. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended well, I am sad to report. Apparently it underperformed elsewhere too, grossing only $7 million, far below expectations. That is a darn shame. I blame both the (intentional or not) mislabeling of this as a 'comedy' when it is nothing near that, and/or fatigue among US audiences on seeing movies about the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. Regardless, I enjoyed ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" a lot for what it is (journalistic war drama). If you have a chance to catch this, be it in theaters, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly encourage you to do so as this movie deserves a bigger audience.

The film effectively explores the personal and professional transformations Barker undergoes during her time in Afghanistan. The narrative, however, occasionally struggles to maintain a consistent tone, veering between comedic moments and more somber reflections. While the movie provides insightful glimpses into the challenges faced by journalists in conflict zones, some viewers might find the pacing uneven. Moments of humor lighten the serious subject matter, yet the transitions between these tones can feel abrupt. Despite these fluctuations, the film succeeds in highlighting the resilience and adaptability required in the demanding world of war journalism.

2,imdb,rachaelblakeegypt,7.0,"7 / 10 Movie is funny and tender The good news is this movie is very funny and very tender, bringing back the very best of Tina Fey as Liz Lemon from her time at 30 Rock. The bad news is that if you've seen the extended preview at the movies, then you've seen most of the movie already. But it is a valiant effort from Fey and company at the life of a news correspondent trying to blow up her life into something new. In this case, as one of the few single people without children she gets the chance to go to Kabul in Afghanistan to report on the war there. This directly results in her character, Kim Baker (who is based on Kim Barker who wrote a book about her experience there as a journalist) getting the chance to stare death in the face and laugh, repeatedly, even when she shouldn't. Journalists from around the globe called such an experience spending time in the Kabubble, sheltered away and yet directly involved in the front lines. Fey's cohorts on the front line of journalism include Margot Robbie and Martin Freeman as well as a Marine Colonel played jovially by Billy Bob Thornton and the Attorney General of Afghanistan played incredibly not seriously by Alfred Molina. Baker arrives and gets thrown to the wolves and uses her I don't care about life attitude to get involved in a gunfight straightaway leading to her being embraced instantly by her peers. Much drinking and carousing ensues thereafter and everyone becomes very close. Not very close are Baker and estranged somewhere on assignment in America boyfriend Chris (Josh Charles) who gets caught cheating on Baker on Skype of all things. Suddenly finding herself single, she is drawn to the oddly charming Iain (Freeman) and a more serious side of the film ensues as a result of this new relationship. Its a different look at the war in Afghanistan from the side of the journalist though the reality of everything is still the same. It starts out very funny then has a long lull and could easily have shaved off 20 minutes from the nearly two hour running time. Though enjoyable there is little about this movie that screams out to be seen on the big screen. I'd wager this is much more suited to a night of Netflix or Red Box.

2,imdb,paulwaidelich,9.0,"9 / 10 Nearly Flawless, 9 out of 10 for Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels Wow. If I wasn't already a fan of Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey, I sure am now. The same barbed wit is evident throughout Whiskey, Tengo Foxtrot (military acronym for What the F***), but this isn't a skit. Tina Fey portrays a nuanced character, a low level employee of a network news department who makes an impulsive career move and ends up as a war correspondent in Afghanistan. Doesn't sound entertaining? It probably wouldn't be without the amazing touch Fey puts on her character. While it's not a war movie, it certainly captures the hopelessness of a culture doomed to perpetual war in the arm pit of the world. Afghanistan ultimately gets dismissed as a place undeserving of American military support, or even interest. The people shoot each other and blow each other up in conflict over interpretations of their medieval religion, and the movie correctly concludes ""who cares""? But the Americans and individual Afghanis touch each others lives in ways that transcend cynicism. Fey and her Saturday Night Live co-producer Lorne Michaels find humor and humanity in ways that make you root for all the characters. The movie has no dull moments, and the pacing keeps you in your seat. Like Afghanistan itself, there were potential landmines of preachiness, boring politics and hopelessness...and WTF avoids them all. There are subtle, brilliant, and stereotype breaking supporting roles by Billy Bob Thornton, Alfred Molina, (Spiderman 2), Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street) and Martin Freeman (whose correspondent character is as far from Bilbo Baggins as Kabul is from New York.) Three cheers for Tina Fey, who manages to give us entertainment and a smile while showing us how lucky we are to be Americans.

Based on the memoir The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan by Kim Barker, 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' is a mostly entertaining War-Dramedy, that is anchored by a Stupendous Performance by Tina Fey. The usually comedic actress, boasts range & class in her first dramatic role (with comic touches, of course). 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' Synopsis: A journalist Kim Baker (Fey) recounts her wartime coverage in Afghanistan. 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' explores Baker's life-changing journey, with moments of fine comedy & dramatic undertones. Her journey wasn't an ordinary one, it had laughs, heartbreaks, violence & even betrayal. But Baker's journey is worth watching on celluloid, as its engaging for the most bit. Robert Carlock's Adapted Screenplay is good, although the last act doesn't quite add up. Baker's Journey is exciting, but the culmination of this chapter of her life, doesn't come up as a whole. The Writing needed to be better, no doubt. Glenn Ficarra & John Requa's Direction is passable. Cinematography is superbly done. Editing is alright. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Performance-Wise: Tina Fey is the life of 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot'. She's in top-form & owns the show form start to end. Martin Freeman is first-rate, as always. Margot Robbie is stunning, both appearance & performance wise. Alfred Molina (with a Afghani accent), is a hoot. His scenes with Fey, are fun to watch. Billy Bob Thornton stands out. Christopher Abbott is very good. On the whole, 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' is worth watching for Fey's Performance alone.",2016-06-14,0,0,260,0.9937,positive,0.771,
2,imdb,shahinmzangeneh,2.0,"2 / 10 What is this movie even trying to convey? ""WTF"" was a rather fruitless exercise in storytelling--it had no real message it wanted to get out there, virtually no character development, and probably no target audience. First, it portrayed the reporters and other foreigners as sociopaths and wholly debauch, juxtaposing the suffering of the Afghan people with the extravagant parties of the unapologetic Westerners and those aligned with them. I kept waiting for an arc that ""Hey, maybe these people will change their ways and genuinely be sympathetic to the natives' issues,"" but that arc never came. In the end, I don't think I walked away from the movie any more sympathetic to anyone, I even ended up disliking virtually every character by sheer inability to relate to them. Who was the target demographic? It had many lines in the movie solely in Dari/Farsi, which I do speak, with subtitles only appearing sporadically. Its main message seemed to be ""Afghanistan sure isn't fun, am I right guys?"" but, who can relate to this? We can all imagine how bad a war torn third world country is, and save 1.5 hrs. It also portrays itself as a black comedy, using the Afghans as a crutch. That's not to say that's not OK--it simply was so wildly unoriginal that it didn't even register as humor. For example, comparing the burka to a Ziploc bag has been circulating Facebook for nearly a decade, but that didn't stop a lazy writer from plugging that into their already bloated, dry film. Another example of the comedic crutch is that some Afghan thinks a black Marine is Russian, because heaven knows Afghans don't know where black people come from, despite many Afghans making yearly pilgrimages to Mecca, where they run into many black Africans. And the only real ""comedy"" that comes to mind which is not wholly reliant on mocking Afghans, is when Fey's character really needs to pee badly, and it's funny because she has to stop the whole platoon, and it's seriously funny no seriously you guys I swear (actually, I forgot it does end with an Afghan crutch, with Fey's character snidely reminding her translator that girls actually pee too, since he--a damned doctor--and his culture oppress women so much they don't even let them pee or realize they pee). I suggest you go out and actually converse with an Afghan instead, instead of mocking people you know nothing about (they literally had an Afghan watching goat porn, what in the goddamn) I can only recommend it if you want to reinforce your belief that all Afghans are complete idiots/perverts and something something journalism is hell. I give it a 2/10 because I actually sat through the entire thing, if only to see what poor excuse for comedy or biopics Hollywood still spits out in this day and age; plus, the performances were fine, but the script is such a travesty that I couldn't even forgive it. But, I will be avoiding films with performances by any of these cast members, which is a shame, because I liked Molina and that Hobbit fella. Oh well.",2016-12-15,0,0,524,-0.9686,negative,0.76,

2,imdb,dave-mcclain,7.0,"7 / 10 ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is a well-named, entertaining war comedy - and much more! Often it happens that the title of a film fails to adequately communicate a given motion picture's subject matter and the film's advertising poster and theatrical trailer provide little additional clarity. If you'll kindly permit me, I shall clarify the title and advertising for the 2016 film ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (R, 1:52). Since the mid-1950s, transportation industries and military forces throughout the western world have used a spelling alphabet called the NATO Phonetic Alphabet. Within this system, each letter of our Latin alphabet is spoken as a specific word beginning with that letter, so as to avoid confusion (especially over various forms of electric and electronic communication) between similar-sounding letters like ""B"" and ""D"", ""F"" and ""S"" or ""M"" and ""N"". The phonetic letters Whiskey, Tango and Foxtrot, for example, represent the Latin letters ""W"", ""T"" and ""F"". Combined as an acronym, ""WTF"" is often used today as an expression of extreme surprise, incredulity, anger, or some combination thereof, e.g., ""WHAT THE F(bleep)?!?"" (Ya feel me?) Accordingly, it is in this context that the film ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" refers to the experience of a westerner becoming personally involved in Operation Enduring Freedom, popularly known as the War in Afghanistan or the Afghanistan War. It is also instructive to note that this film is oft identified as a war comedy, a label supported by the prominent image of popular comedienne Tina Fey on the movie poster and by the video clips and narration used in the theatrical trailer. In reality, however, this film is more of a drama than a comedy, a fact which should not necessarily imply a lesser degree of enjoyment in watching this film. (This ends the lesson. Here begins the plot summary.) WTF indeed! Living and working in a war zone is no joke. And it's not just the constant danger that gets you wanting to look to the heavens and shout those three letters (or the words they represent). It's also the culture shock, some of the ways that the military and other outsiders do things over there, some of the people you meet and work with, etc. It's all this and more that confounds, frustrates, infuriates and eventually motivates cable news reporter Kim Barker and also leads her to find the humor in the midst of any number of situations that most people would consider anything but funny. As an actress, Fey had help, as did screenwriter Robert Carlock and co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. This film is loosely based on the 2011 quirky and darkly comedic memoir ""The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan"" by former Chicago Tribune South Asia bureau chief / reporter Kim Barker. As Barker, we see Fey volunteering for an assignment as a war correspondent in Afghanistan. She has a steady boyfriend (Josh Charles), but she nevertheless feels like she's stuck in a rut and she needs a change. Her arrival in Afghanistan is quite the culture shock as she has to get used to wearing a head scarf whenever she's around the locals and is forced to ""fix"" her bright orange camera bag before she's allowed in a military vehicle. She gets help adjusting from Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie), the only other female reporter in the area, and from interpreter Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott), a bodyguard (Stephen Peacocke) and a video guy (Nicholas Braun). Soon, Kim establishes a good working relationship with local Marine commander General Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) and she starts to do some gutsy reporting, gets some excellent stories on the air and even starts to enjoy herself. Kim's steep learning curve, however, is just the beginning of her challenges. Her gutsy reporting endangers herself and others, but she continues to take greater and greater risks to get the story. Then there's the problem of getting air time for her stories. She does excellent work, but as the Iraq War heats up, she finds herself covering what becomes something of a forgotten war. Still, she keeps plugging away. Her initial three-month-long commitment to her assignment becomes much longer, sucking her more and more deeply into a ""new normal"", which is actually anything but, and puts a steadily increasing strain on her relationship with her boyfriend back home. The separation isn't easy on Kim either. She finds herself attracted to her bodyguard, pursued by a Scottish photojournalist (Martin Freeman) and stalked by a high-ranking Afghan official (Alfred Molina) who wants to trade information for sex. Eventually, Kim has to make tough choices about her relationships, her work and her future. ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" is indeed a war comedy, but it's much more than that. Although a few small details don't ring true, most of this film looks and feels very authentic. If you've ever wanted to know what it might be like to be in or around the military on a deployment – without actually worrying about bullets and IEDs – this movie is for you. Yet, rather than a story filled with battles and danger, in between the few but well-done intense moments, Movie Fans will experience much more than they might expect by seeing the story through Kim's eyes and in the context of her personal journey. Casting Fey in the starring role ensures that the film remains true to the spirit of the book, and that the audience will be entertained by her usual wry, although toned-down humor.

2,imdb,Troy_Campbell,6.0,"6 / 10 Entertaining enough, but there's a more interesting story in here somewhere. Crafting out a comedy within the setting of a real life war is not an easy task. Which probably explains why the humour dries up halfway through and this sorta-biography heads down a more earnest, and rewarding, path. Recounting reporter Kim Barker's (Baker in the film) journey from desk-jockey to on-the-ground war correspondent in Afghanistan (circa 2003-2006), the movie leans heavily on clichéd fish-out-of-water antics for the first act to squeeze out a couple of titter-worthy moments. When the following two acts become more serious and reveal deeper layers in both the story and our likable protagonist, the interest level drastically increases, but it also highlights just how miscalculated the comedy-angle was to begin with. Adapted from Barker's 2011 memoirs 'The Taliban Shuffle', the screenplay suffers from numerous time-jumps that muddy the journalist's personal growth rather than emphasise it, whilst a few supporting characters are given oddly anti-climactic closures. A more in-depth mini-series beckoned. Tina Fey brings her usual dry wit and every-woman charm to the role of Baker, sharing a nice chemistry with Martin Freeman who almost steals the show as the irreverent and arrogant Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie. Unfortunately Margot Robbie is completely one dimensional as fellow journo Tanya Vanderpoel – who could be a Brit, Kiwi or Aussie going by Robbie's accent – whilst Alfred Molina is woefully miscast as the sleazy Afghan official Ali Massoud Sadiq.

The movie, devoid of dialogue which never gets annoying or irritating is filled with immense emotional heft, and it delivers ridiculously entertaining, ludicrous almost john wick style action. While the storyline is a variant of ""Punisher"" and ""Death Wish,"" it's crafted with such style and panache that you're utterly captivated throughout.

Almost no one speaks a word of dialogue through the entire film. Does it work? NOPE. NOT AT ALL. Because film makers believe the audience is incredibly stupid, now more than ever. And without character motivations carefully explained through words all that is left to do is make every single action that appears on screen cartoonish beyond belief. I kid you not, what appears on screen in this film also works as a perfect parody of modern action movies. This film can be hilarious if you choose to view it from that perspective. I laughed out loud a lot. I am giving it 3 stars because it is filmed competently. Visually appealing, well edited, well choreographed action. But without believable situations and characters to care about it all falls flat.

1,imdb,nicolasroop,2.0,"2 / 10 No dialog absolutely ruins this film, among other things I respect John Woo's decision to try to make a film with no dialog and the story to be expressed through his imagery rather than a script. The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin. A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch. The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here. I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off. Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen.

1,imdb,kjproulx,6.0,"6 / 10 Great Action, but a little too Melodramatic John Woo is a filmmaker I admittedly haven't seen a tonne of work from, but he undeniably has a vision for action sequences. That is what he is known for and he has stuck to that throughout most of his career in the business. Face/Off and Hard Boiled are awesome action films, so if I ever get the chance, I'll check out his latest. Well, Silent Night is his latest American effort and I must say, he hasn't lost his touch with action. With that said though, it was just okay overall. It has a lot of promise and some great ideas, but something bogged it down for me. Here are my thoughts. After a gang accidentally kills the son of a couple just trying to live a happy life, the husband, Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) decides to go after them. He ends up shot in the neck, preventing him from ever speaking a word again. His mission then becomes to train his body to take on this gang and kill them all. The unique aspect of this film is the fact that it is told entirely without dialogue. Not a single one of the characters speaks one word. I enjoyed that aspect, but I do wish it was utilized more than just having nobody speak. Nothing was interesting past the point of just not having him talk. It was clear that Woo just wanted to focus on the action and that was worth the price of admission. There wasn't a lot of originality in terms of the action set pieces, but it was all very well-choreographed. From a standout fight that takes place in a house, to a great stairwell scene, the action held my attention. With that said, the good aspects of this film are bogged down by the sappy nature of the backstory. The way his past with his child is presented is kind of cheesy at first and there is a specific moment towards the end of the film that almost made me chuckle when it was clear the film was trying to be very emotional. The schmaltz of it all overtook the film and ruined a few moments. Joel Kinnaman is an actor I like very much and his performance here is quite solid, but I'm not sure he was given enough to do, other than either be incredibly angry or sad. It's a very thin story and screenplay and the final product shows that. Still, if you enjoy action, there is enough here to satisfy viewers. The absent dialogue is a great idea, but this type of film needed some in my opinion. Silent Night is a little too cheesy at times, but I still think it's worth a watch if you are already interested.

Pretty action visuals, but severely lacking in real thrill and credibility Director John Woo got world famous for his fabulous action visuals during the nineties. This picture still looks the part, but that is about the only positive I can find... The bad: the action only starts after 50 minutes. Besides an action packed opening scene of a few minutes no thrilling action to be seen during the first 50 minutes. Is the action any good then? Well yes and no. As I said before, the action looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame. Credibility near zero. More bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork. And although there is one big, bad crime guy who was supposed to be the ultimate evil, but he wasnt impressing me either.

1,imdb,MB-reviewer185,7.0,"7 / 10 Action speaks louder than words This being a new action movie directed by John Woo is what got me interested in the movie, along with it being a Christmas action movie starring actor Joel Kinnaman; other than that, the fact that main character loses his voice is what also got me interested on how the movie was going to go. The Christmas action movie Silent Night (2023) is a fun by the numbers revenge film that has good performances, good cinematography, and fun action; the movie is not perfect, because of how it could take the premise farther or impacted the character. Joel Kinnaman gives an exceptionally satisfactory performance not saying anything throughout the movie because of his character losing his voice and gives a lot of facial expressions to show what he is feeling right in the situation, with an occasional raspy yell and talking with his wife by texting at one point. He gets revenge for his son being killed, and there are a lot of moments where you can tell he is upset and is reminiscing everything he did with his son; most of the movie is him getting ready to put his revenge into effect, which was cool to see, and him getting info on certain gang members for the police to turn in. I would have liked if him losing his voice effected his revenge plan in a way that makes sense, so there was a bit more suspense in a way when he is trying to communicate with other people to help them in certain shoot outs. The antagonists are just standard gangs on the streets that are there to be killed in many brutal and bloody ways that are fun to watch; the action sequences are mostly well shot with particularly good cinematography like with shoot outs and car chases, but some action scenes could have reduced the number of cuts that were used. What I thought was impressive was that there are no lines of dialogue from every person throughout the entire movie, except in radio transmissions and in small whispers at times; I like how it focuses on facial expressions to get character's feelings across, but I would have liked some dialogue from the side characters since the main character cannot say anything. I can see why there are people who will hate this movie, but I thought Silent Night (2023) was a fun action movie that had an impressive performance from Joel Kinnaman, and well-done cinematography in the fun action scenes; there are issues like it being like all other action revenge movies, but it is entertaining to watch. Director John Woo has done a respectable job directing, and if you like him as a director, I recommend this movie; not a must watch, but it is a fun Christmas action movie to watch whenever you get the chance.",2023-12-23,0,0,482,0.9928,positive,0.754,

John Woo's disappointing action revenge flick with Kinnaman seeking vengeance on gangbangers who accidentally killed his son on Christmas has so much potential but is squandered in its hole-laden script by Robert Archer Lynn (i.e. Namely the sadly misused talent of Sandino Moreno as the spouse who basically just passively cries while her husband for months on end is holed up in their basement preparing for war). While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job).

I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. Boy were my Spidey-Senses off on this one. When the film set itself up in a way that meant there was going to be very little dialogue I thought, oh no, that's not going to make for a good film. The crazy thing is that I had no idea just how bad it was actually going to be. I've never been so bored and lacking interest in a film before - and I absolutely love revenge movies.

1,imdb,bickelbickelbickel,1.0,"1 / 10 First movie where I have left the theater, wanting my money back Well, I do like what John Woo did different by making an action movie with ZERO dialogue and nice cinemtography, this movie was awful. I am not someone who expects movies to be realistic. Because lets face it, if that were true, I would never see 99% of the movies that have been made. My mom will tell you i usually like bad movies. But i still feel that main plot points of a movie need to make some sense. And I just found too many things in this movie that didn't. First, I will start off with the fact that these career gang members have the accuracy of a two-year-old with a Nerf gun. In the beginning of the film, there is a scene, that you can see in the trailer, that involves two rival gangs driving in cars and shooting at each other. Despite the fact that these cars are within 2 feet of each other and all of these big bad guys have automatic weapons, neither side hits each other for miles. Then, in the last act of the movie that is the big shootout in the building, again that you can see in the movie's trailer, these lifetime criminals run up on the guy and don't get a bullet off before this homebody dad shoots them? You have got to be kidding me! Harry Potter had better accuracy in ""Guns Akimbo"". My other problem is with the main character himself. The movie plays up how he spends nine months preparing to exact revenge and kill all the gang members with fight training from youtube, target practice and working out. Yet the first fight he gets in he gets his ass kicked horribly. If I were him, I would get all the money back I paid for the gun club because the training did absolutely nothing. The only reason he can kill any of them is because the gang members have the accuracy of a magic eight ball. Joel is a scrawny dad and yet this tough gang can't kill him? He's not John Wick. And the only thing that has been on his mind all this time is revenge. How come whenever he killed somebody he looked upset about it? Lastly, while I do get that emotion plays a big part in this movie because there is no dialogue, those scenes were repetitive and very long. Half of them were unnecessary and just a drag. The plot line to this movie is not unique at all. In fact, it was like a Tubi version of Death Wish, The Punisher, Death Sentence, etc.. That combined with the ridiculous so-called gang members is why I dislike and was very disappointed in this film.",2023-12-02,0,0,470,-0.9981,negative,0.746,
1,imdb,movies_are_life_,7.0,"7 / 10 Get the word out and talk about this one...mostly. First and foremost, this movie will not be for everyone simply because it is mostly dialogue-free. Truly silent, minus a few bits of radio chatter and music with action sound effects. This is what sets it apart from other revenge flicks, though, and part of the reason why it is fresh, but also a little problematic. It has to get to the action as quickly as it can, but needs to fill the run time, so has a shaky first half, albeit a very rewarding second half. Many movies, especially from the past 10 years, start twenty minutes later than movies used to begin. Character building is lost because we are thrown into the action. For this to truly work, on a quick popcorn movie, the film would have to be just over an hour. Since we are over that theoretical minimum of 90 minutes, there's a chunk of slow-moving scenes at the start. We get hit over the head with the reasoning behind the vengeance, and it's done in a slow, no dialogue way. Once you get past this, then you can settle in for some very good action scenes! Luckily these action scenes are rewarding enough to deal with a frustratingly unlikeable hero and a shallow supporting cast. I could definitely see rewatching this, but only for the practical action that is very well directed. Some people may not get far enough into the movie appreciate some John Woo thrills, but if you give it 30 minutes (or chapter skips), then it's very worth your time.",2023-11-30,0,0,270,0.9914,positive,0.775,

They believe the place is haunted and follow three rules of survival: they must be in bed by midnight; they may not allow a stranger to cross the threshold; and they must stay together. When they are eighteen, their tutor and lawyer Bermingham (David Bradley) advises that they must sell the real estate since their trust fund is exhausted but Edward is reluctant to leave the property. When Rachel is flirted by the handicapped soldier Sean (Eugene Simon) that returned from the war to his family house at the nearby village, she feels a great attraction and breaks the rules imposed by The Lodgers with tragic consequences. ""The Lodgers"" is a melancholic Irish ghost story with a wonderful cinematography. The non-commercial story has ambiguous interpretation until the conclusion when the truth about the place and the twins is disclosed. The plot is developed at a slow pace and has no gore, and maybe this is the reason to have negative reviews. However it is worthwhile watching by fans of ghost stories. My vote is six.

Its this rather refreshing, open ended approach that works well in the context of this film. A film whose central themes are the inevitability of change and the need for self fulfilment and love, even in the face of well established yet corrupted tradition. Its a story set against a backdrop that's reminiscent of aspects of Great Expectations and Wuthering Heights but there's a good deal of departure in terms of the overriding story from both of those tales. What really set this film apart for me was the stunning visuals combined with simple but effective, special effects. The result is a surreal experience that somehow's familiar but at the same time, eerie and other worldly. A good effort from the Emerald Isle.

Sadly, they then decided to make the film, and what sounds good in type sadly failed to translate into action. It's a lovely big house, nice quaint setting, seems authentically period in dress and mood and then the story starts and it all goes to pieces which is a real shame as this could have potentially been a good film had they made it half as good as the written synopsis. The pacing was so slow that it finished third in a two horse race, there simply wasn't enough story to beef it up and at times it just seemed lost in a vortex of nothingness. It took so long to get to the punchline that honestly, by the time it got there i'd forgotten the build up and didn't really care what the punchline would be. It was beautifully shot, atmospheric shadows and lighting throughout, nice use of angles and perspective and for the material they were dealt, the cast done a not bad job of carrying it out but it just seemed like it was trying too hard to be a 'feels' filled film with a hint of horror and mystery thrown in but the story was so bland that any hint of mystery was lost, it just didn't intrigue the way it obviously wanted to. No doubt we'll have some 'Luvvies' drooling over this, calling it 'genre defining' or some such nonsense but in reality it just isn't and I for one am quite disappointed at that fact.",2018-02-24,0,0,270,-0.683,negative,0.794,

5,imdb,robinalers,6.0,"6 / 10 Not what you want it to be Let's begin with saying that the movie is definitely still worth the time to see. As there are a few moments where The Nun is portrayed in such a way that you do feel how great and powerful it is, and the music during these scenes (trust me, you will recognise them when you see them) is incredible. You'll feel hopeless, just as the characters at that time, but unfortunately these moments are scarce. As human being, we find darkness scary, we hate it because we cannot see properly and thus find ourselves in the unknown. This is what drives a good horror movie, it is why the first Paranormal Activity was such a success for example. The horror of things happening, but not knowing what it is or where it is. The Nun fails to deliver this horror of the unknown. As we, in almost all scenes, see what it is that should terrify us, in great and gory detail. And while I love a tip of the hat to a more old school type of horror (more gore and monstrous feelings), I do not like how The Nun delivers it. The amount of times we see a close up of the face of the nun is insane, and takes away the fear that this character had left us in during the Conjuring movies. It was the lack of screentime and the darkness surrounding this character that made her so extremely scary and interesting in those movies. It reminded me of the Devil's face in the original Exorcist movie. We don't see it often, but when we see it it terrifies us, because we cannot quite tell all the characteristics of its face, and it is always surrounded by darkness. The Nun is blatantly obvious, and her screaming in the camera makes it feel more like you're watching The Mummy, than The Nun. Then there's the writing, the addition of comic relief is a good idea, but the timing is always off and rarely funny. The storyline is a bit basic, a gateway to hell, again, a demon needs a body, again, our past haunts us, again; it delivers nothing we haven't seen already. And I don't mind that, but then at least deliver it with tenacity. The jump scares feel as though they know that the audience knows its coming, so they just try to come at you from a different position than you expect: e.g., camera does a full 360, we expect something to happen, it doesn't and then something drops from above. No, the movie disappoints. The story is basic, the timing of humor is laughable and the excessive amount of screentime - for that which petrified us with hardly any in the Conjuring movies - makes the Nun into something we hoped it wouldn't be. And unfortunately the great scenery, actually horrifying scenes and amazing soundtrack just can't lift this movie beyond 'just another horror movie'.",2018-09-05,0,0,501,-0.9937,negative,0.712,

5,imdb,tonyjcole94,3.0,"3 / 10 Very VERY VERY cliche. Lots of jump scares. Dragging plot. This film is OBVIOUSLY missing the James Wan touch that we loved in the conjuring universe films. Even when Wan used jump scares , it worked bc the atmosphere was tense and creepy . In ""The Nun"" they're overly planted everywhere in the movie to make up for the fact that the director couldn't keep the audience captivated any other way. The plot is basic to say the least, it's almost like they just threw it together in 5 minutes to make up a back story for The Nun. The film had so much potential to give the audience a interesting creepy back story to one of the conjuring's iconic villains. Instead we're saturated with filler for the 1st and 2nd act , and FINALLY get something going on the final act . Up until then it's nothing but jump scare city . So if that's up your alley for horror movies then you'll love this . I personally think the brief amount of time The Nun was in the Conjuring 2 was 100000x better than this full length film. They also tried to go with this new trend of adding some comedy into a horror film and it's just badly placed and awkward . The acting is okay . Taissa Farmiga & Demien Bichir are the main characters and give pretty good performances. Anyway, Overall this movie could've gone straight to DVD or Netflix . Don't think it deserved to hit the big screen if it wasn't going to be directed by Wan . There's some creepy/scary enjoyable moments but overall it's very cliche and downright boring at times.

5,imdb,CoffinVideo1983,6.0,"6 / 10 Good Demonic/Religious Horror Film... Preface: I'm not the biggest fan of the Conjuring series as a whole. Overall, The Nun was a pretty good movie. The film was shot wonderfully, locations were beautiful, color was perfect, and FX were spot on. That being said... for a demonic style horror film, I really prefer a little more background. With films out like Hereditary that are based in real, historically accurate lore, the bar has been set higher in that genre. The Nun's plot seemed rather thrown together to me. On the plus side... Taissa Farmiga is an amazing actor and was brilliant. I almost give her full credit for me liking the film as much as I did. I really believe she is a staple to the horror genre. Bonnie Aarons is amazing as the Nun as well. I do wish they would use a little prosthetics on her to keep the nun from looking so much like her. After her role in these films I don't know if i'll ever be able to see her as anything but an evil, demonic nun. Overall... I give 6 out of 10.",2019-08-17,0,0,192,0.8593,positive,0.79,

This installment of one of the most successful horror franchises - The Conjuring - is this horrifying sequel to the blockbuster. Well produced by James Wan and Peter Safran (producers of all the films in the franchise); it's a terrifying Ghost story that finds an evil nun seeking vendetta and carrying out a criminal spree. This scary movie produced by the successful James Wan who presents another creepy horror tale with a Nun as starring. 1952, when a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, the Vatican assigns a peculiar duo to investigate it. A priest with a haunted past, Father Burke (as Demian Bichir) and a young nun (Taissa Farmiga) on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate the death of a young nun in Romania and confront a malevolent force in the form of a demonic nun. Together they uncover the order's unholy secret. Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in 'The Conjuring 2,' as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned. The greatest evil in The Conjuring Universe !. Confess your sins !. Witness the Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe !. Pray For Forgiveness !. She Doesn't Forgive !. Witness the Darkest Chapter in The Conjuring Universe !. Terror film that shows the chilling origins of the possessed nun Valak, who became known in 'Warren file: Enfield case'. Prequel/Spin of the Warren File franchise, stars Demián Bichir and Taissa Farmiga, also makes a brief appearance in the epilogue of the Patrick Wilson film and Vera Farmiga, portraying their characters from the original series. It displays relentless chiller , intrigue , shocks, hard-edged drama , plot twists , creepy images and some gore when crimes takes place. This hit 'The Nun' in which the scream queen Tessa Farmiga puts on the habit to kill the chilling demon Valak, she plays a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows sent by the Vatican to investigate. Here Taissa Farmiga and Demian Bichir confront the very thing that haunts their dreams and forever links them together in hushed silence. They battle a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun (Bonnie Aaarons) that first terrorized audiences in 'The Conjuring 2,' as the convent becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned. This frightening movie is plenty of thrills , screams , gore, eerie scenes, high body-count and lurid images with lots of eerie scenes, blood and gore. This worldwide smash hit follows Sister Irene who comes face-to-face with Valak, the demon nun. It is an usual horror movie where the intrigue , tension , suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room , corridors , church and convent, including some chilling frames. The main protagonists are Demian Bichir, Tessa Farmiga (Nun I, Mula, The twilight Zone) giving good performances as the priest with dark past and the brave nun who helps him. And Bonnie Aarons and Jonas Bloquet installment as Valak and Frenchie respectively. Special effects are pretty well but there are several scenes without much sense and the main and secondary interpretations are acceptable. Interesting premise about a heinous nun is partially wasted but it has its moments here and there. It containg a tense and suspenseful musical score by Abel Korzeniowski , an expert on terror movies and dark atmosphere. As well as a somber and gloomy cinematography by cameraman Maxime Alexandre. Shooting took place at the Corvin Castle in Hunedoara, and in Sighisoara, Transylvania, Romania, and also at Mogosoaia Palace, near Bucharest, Romania. This spooky movie was efficiently directed Corin Hardy (The Hallow, Gangs of London) in her second feature film. Followed by ¨The Nun II¨by Michael Chaves, set in 1956 in Tarancon (France) four years after the demonic events of 1952, Father Noiret burns to death in the air. Valek's demon has died and Sister Irene, who now serves in a convent in Italy, must once again face this evil to return him to hell. Stars Irene (Tessa Farmiga), Debra (Storm Reid), the teacher Kate (Anna Popplewell); on the other hand, repeat in this second entry Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet) and The Nun (Bonnie Aarons) . While Valak often tormenting students with her own brand of extreme religious zealotry, this nightmarish nun was deathly strict with her code of ethics. James Wan goes to production this time and is also co-author of the story on which the script is based together with the screenwriter Gary Dauberman: Annabelle Comes Home, Anabelle: creation. The saga Warren marriage : Patrick Wilson/Vera Farmiga is formed as follows : The Conjuring (2013) by James Wan , The Conjuring 2 (2016) by James Wan and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) by Michael Chaves .

5,imdb,jtindahouse,5.0,"5 / 10 A huge let down If you had told me five years ago that one of my most anticipated movies of 2018 would be titled 'The Nun' I would've been very surprised. It was though. I had been looking forward to this movie ever since it was announced. I'm a huge fan of both of 'The Conjuring' movies, but have admittedly not loved either of the two 'Annabelle' spin-offs. I was very pleased to see James Wan was attached to the writing side of things on this one though and so held out high hopes for it. Sadly though, I have to report this is another complete misfire. Starting with the positives though - the movie looks great. The set decoration is truly terrific in nearly every scene and the building and surrounding area that the film is set in were ideally selected. The groundwork was there for this to be a very creepy movie. At times the movie does work too, but that is mainly when it is being subtle. There are a lot of scenes where images of 'The Nun' are sort of there, but also sort of not. You question yourself whether you are actually seeing what you think you are. I really liked that side of things. Too often though the film is far too in your face. The demon will jump out of a tree and scream into a character's face (a very lion-like and un-scary scream I would have to say as well). The dialogue in this film is a real mess too, which surprised me considering Wan's involvement. The character of 'Frenchie' is particularly painful. He is meant to be the comic relief, but nothing he says is in any way funny, and is frankly a little embarrassing in parts. Also some of the things the demon says like, ""The village will be missing its idiot tomorrow"" (or something to that effect), are cringe-worthy and should never have made the final cut. I was very let down by this film. There are a lot of jump-scares, and not one of them gave me the slightest jolt. My heart-rate never rose above resting in any scene and I was frankly bored for the most part. The only saving graces were that the film looked great, connected in with the rest of the series well and had a truly great final scene that left me a little blown away.

On the next morning, Irene is accepted in the abbey and learns that there is a gate to hell in the catacombs. Meanwhile Burke finds that a demon called Valak has unleashed through a breach. Now they have to seal the breach with the blood of Christ to trap Valak inside the gate.

The cinematography is magnificent, the atmosphere is spooky and the cast has good performances.

5,imdb,tjlisson,3.0,"3 / 10 For Teenagers OK but ultimately run-of-the-mill horror. The budget theater I saw this flick in was filled with noisy teenagers yacking and reacting throughout, which would have been a lot worse if I really thought I was missing much. There are a couple of other annoyances that seem to have gone over other people's heads here. For one, although the movie makes much of this being in Romania, and indeed it was filmed there, hardly anyone seems to actually be Romanian. What's really a bothersome anomaly, though, is that the convent and the people involved are Roman Catholic. Certainly there is Roman Catholicism in Romania, but generally only amongst ethnic minorities, especially Hungarians. Actual ethnic Romanians with any religious affiliation, however, almost always identify as Romanian Orthodox, and that is a very important distinction that any Romanian will immediately notice. People elsewhere may think that's no big deal, but just imagine you have a movie set in Italy and every one there is an Episcopalian.

It tells essentially the origin story of The Conjuring 2 (2016) nun antagonist and truth be told was one which I had high hopes for despite my opinion on the rest of the universe. The previous movies being Conjuring 1/2 and Annabelle 1/2 accumulated from me a total of 14/40 potential stars so I think its sufficed to say that they haven't exactly blown me away. I've claimed for years that when it comes to horror Hollywood have thoroughly lost their way and The Nun has done nothing to change my mind. From the Conjuring to Insidious all the high budgeted Hollywood horrors are glossy cliched messes. Being that I consider ""The Nun"" to be a suitably creepy and well designed character I figured the movie would at least look the part! When the setting turned out to be a creepy old convent I was positively salivating. What incredible potential this movie had! Now all it needed was some passable writing and we could have a modern day classic here. Sadly there is no passable writing, there is mindless Hollywood writing. No consistency, no structure, no intelligence just a clusterpoop of random imagery and stupidity. Potential hobbled, tarred, feathered and kicked down 7 sets of stairs. The Good: The ""Nun"" herself is excellent The Bad: Bland cast Poorly constructed plot Everything you fear from Hollywood horror Things I Learnt From This Movie: Hollywood know how to drop the ball like nobody else If this had been an indie movie it would have been considerably better All the talent in the Farmiga family went to Vera If Jesus ever actually returned and saw crosses everywhere I'm pretty sure he'd have a nervous breakdown",2018-11-09,0,0,314,-0.9146,negative,0.777,

5,imdb,Symbiossys,9.0,"9 / 10 Not sure what everyone is so pissed about. I just saw the movie this weekend, at 4DX 2D, and I can tell you truthfully I had tons of fun. We went with some friends, after ignoring all the negative and bad reviews over the web. We even heard some of our friends who had already seen the movie, bashing it with negatives, but we decided to go anyway. I am not a sucker for horror movies, let's just sort that one out, but I loved the previous two Conjuring movies, and had also seen Annabelle. I didn't like Annabelle as much as I did like The Nun. It was something new, a new touch to the story, and although it wasn't directed by James Wan, it was still good! Yes, it has a lot of jump scares, sometimes predictable, sometimes not, but it's still fun. The rush you feel when the chair you're sitting in starts jerking chaotically and the characters in front of you scream in fear, that's what I was looking for. After all you go to a movie to have fun, not to judge and analyze every bit of it. What would it become of a movie, if everything would be perfect and carefully thought through. I enjoyed the story, even if it felt a bit rushed in the beginning. The eerie feeling the movie gives you, represents a big plus as well. You feel isolated and alone throughout the whole experience, and it makes you feel better when other characters join the action, and the band gets back together. I mean, a priest, a nun who hasn't pledged herself to becoming a full nun and a farmer, well. How bad could this trio be? Let me tell you, they fit perfectly. Although the Nun herself, or let's say Valak, didn't have much screen time, except toward the end, you still felt her/his presence throughout the movie. Overall a fun and enjoyable ride. A few cliché moments, but still good toward the end. Great effects and a total blast seen at 4DX 2D. So, if you enjoy horror movies, and you're not one of those fellas who goes to the movie with a pencil and a notebook in his hand, in order to analyze and criticize everything he sees, you're good to go.

5,imdb,fabiomuca,7.0,"7 / 10 It's fine ""The Nun"" is a supernatural horror film that carries the weight of high expectations due to its connection to ""The Conjuring"" universe. While it boasts some chilling moments and atmospheric settings, it falls short in certain areas. Here's a 7/10 review: ""The Nun"" presents a visually striking Gothic backdrop that sets the stage for some genuinely hair-raising moments. The eerie atmosphere and effective jump scares contribute to a decent horror experience. However, the plot feels somewhat convoluted at times, and character development could have been stronger. The titular character, Valak, portrayed by Bonnie Aarons, is undeniably creepy and captivating, but the story around her leaves some unanswered questions. Despite its flaws, ""The Nun"" manages to deliver a fair share of scares, and fans of the horror genre may find it enjoyable, especially if they are already invested in ""The Conjuring"" universe. It may not reach the heights of some of its predecessors, but it still offers a spooky night at the movies for those seeking a good scare.",2023-10-03,0,0,173,-0.3635,negative,0.784,
5,imdb,nimdude,4.0,"4 / 10 Technically decent, narratively ridiculous and unconvincing The Nun is another chapter in the marvel cin ... conjuring cinematic universe that for some reason keeps expanding. The jumpscare plagued, unexplained and way too over the top plot is such a waste due to the fact that technically, this movie is the best in the conjuring universe. The cgi, production design, cinematography and the haunting soundtrack are all very very decent. However none of this can make up for the nonsensical satanic mess that this movie turned out to be. Virtually completely non frightening, the Nun itself as a presence loses its ominousness very early into the second act. It is always shown in the same way as in the trailer. A creepy choir and a floating nun. It gets very boring after a while, and even when the atmosphere starts to seem somewhat decent, you get taken out of it even more when the misplaced and useless comic relief character opens his mouth. The acting is mostly passable but the actors aren't given much to work with in the first place. Most of this film is just a continuous barrage of ""scary"", meaningless scenes that add up to nothing but cheap jumpscsres. As a part of the conjuring universe it does NOT IN ANY WAY explain the origins of the Nun. The only thing it does for the universe is set up a sequel and another possible prequel. 4.3/10",2018-09-04,0,0,241,-0.9142,negative,0.881,

6,imdb,pduffek,8.0,"8 / 10 Great Debut I think the comparison of Monkey Man and John Wick is not so correct. Sure.......both are revenge story. But both are conceived quite differently. John Wick delved into the universe of hitmen, while Monkey Man is a straight and dirty action thriller. It's actually a ""superhero"" movie after Indick. One of the big pluses is the atmosphere and setting. The movie is really Indian and not a US movie set in India. The approach to the story is related to this. The film starts off sharp and tries to keep it up for the entire footage. I also have to praise the action sequences. It is not a revolution, but they are filmed excellently and relatively raw. The main character is likable and relatable. Of course, the film is not perfect and anyone could argue that it is a fairly standard story about revenge. And it is so........... but it is done differently and brilliantly. A beautiful 8.5/10 for me.",2024-07-26,0,0,165,0.9033,positive,0.77,

The film starts off well and builds momentum for a decent revenge arc although it is hard to follow sometimes. The shakey camera work contributes to this as well as the dialogue not being particularly clear. However what takes this film from good to great is the final third. The music, the action, the violence, it was just so incredibly well done especially for first time director. I couldn't take my eyes off it and didn't know what to expect next.

6,imdb,Orlando_Gardner,8.0,"8 / 10 A really solid and surprising 7.5 A really enjoyable and at times moving actioner, with a good heart and enough social commentary to elevate it above the ordinary. First time director (and kudos to him, this is a brilliant debut film) and star Dev Patel shows here that he is a director to watch and a bonified movies star. The boy has chops. Here he plays Monkey Man, an underground street fighter just striving to make a living in the slums of India but with a burning desire for vengeance. As the film progresses we are slowly introduced to both the target(s) of his vengeance and the reasons he is crippled by it. You've seen this all before in a hundred films of its type but this has enough style and substance to it to stand out from the rest. The fights scenes (especially as the film progresses and our protagonist improves) are dynamic and kinetic, the camera never stops moving. But there are enough quiet, still, thoughtful moments here to raise this film above the usual chaff. The flashback scenes are filled with warmth and beauty and show a real eye as a director. The film uses music exceptionally well to add both gravitas and levity to scenes where needed. With influences from western cinema, Indian cinema and especially 90s East Asian action flicks this film has enough pace and action for the fight movie fans but also enough of a story and heart for the general movie goer. You'll be rooting for our eponymous Monkey Man to get his vengeance. As I said a really excellent directorial debut from an already established young, proper movie star. The future really looks bright for Mr Patel.",2024-03-26,0,0,289,0.9936,positive,0.802,
6,imdb,BA_Harrison,7.0,"7 / 10 Dev Patel, action star. If you had told me a year ago that Dev Patel would play India's answer to John Wick, I would have thought you were crazy, but here we are with Monkey Man, in which the actor directs himself as a man determined to take revenge on the people who murdered his mother and stole their land. The film features plenty of brutal fight action - a mix of gun play and hand to hand combat - but Patel succumbs to that irritating trend - shaky cam with rapid editing; I'm sure this technique hides a multitude of sins, but it always feels a bit like a cop out to me and makes it rather difficult to follow the action. Monkey Man also suffers from erratic pacing, with lulls in the action that go on for a tad too long. If Patel had had the confidence to shoot his fight scenes in a less chaotic manner and had kept the pace more consistent, I think the film would have been better for it. That said, I didn't dislike the movie as a whole - Patel does well in his role as avenging angel and the level of violence is impressive. I definitely had far more fun with Monkey Man than either of the other two big screen releases I have seen recently: Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire and Godzilla x Kong, both of which were hugely disappointing.",2024-03-30,0,0,241,-0.9647,negative,0.641,
6,imdb,ocnkyle,6.0,"6 / 10 Some Great Elements, But Not A Great Movie Huge Dev Patel fan. Monkey Man is the first movie I've gone to see in the theaters in a very long time. I just don't get interested enough to not wait for it to be streaming. Monkey Man compelled me to go. It's probably the best movie trailer I've ever seen, or at least one of the best. The problem with the trailer that I foresee is many are going to walk out of the theater feeling misled. If you're an action movie fan, DO NOT GO SEE THIS IN THEATERS. Wait for streaming. This is a drama with elements of action and crime thriller. Anyone going in who thinks this is like John Wick will be sorely disappointed. The problem is, that's the impression the trailer gives. I'm actually not even a John Wick fan. I like action movies, but I don't seek them out often. What I thought could make Monkey Man special was the added substance of Indian mythology, culture, and a more fleshed out character drama that was hinted at in the trailer. Some of that was present, but it didn't come together nearly as well as I had hoped. I don't agree with the severe criticism of the action scenes and how they were filmed. I thought they were good and the shaky cam didn't bother me. Could it have been better? Probably. But I think the criticism there is overblown. Where the film missed its mark for me was the story itself. The first act was good, but in the second act it ground to a halt for 40 minutes or so of more of what we already learned in act 1, at the expense of pacing. Some parts were fleshed out way too much while other parts weren't fleshed out enough, making it feel off almost the whole movie. The supporting characters didn't get enough of this, which didn't help us care about them and also care about them joining the fight with our protagonist. I'm genuinely surprised at some of Dev's choices in Act 2. I actually admire him for trying to make a movie with more substance that could be called action to some degree, but I just think he didn't nail the blend of these things with Monkey Man. You could argue that he tried to do too much. There was a significant amount of extended flashback used throughout even up to the very end. This ended up taking us out of the present and hurting the flow of the story. I think Monkey Man as Dev Patel envisioned it might have been much better as a limited series. So that he could take his time and flesh everything out the way he wanted. Because again, there were some great elements in this movie. Good acting, good cinematography, good music (although it sounds as if it was more stereotypical Indian music and other cultural elements used), some great fight scene moments, and some fun bits. It just doesn't add up to a great movie. Someone else mentioned they felt detached a bit, and I agree. Despite the protagonist's story having the right emotional elements to draw us in, it didn't do it as much I had hoped for me. What I envision is a lot of people going into this expecting a pure action thrill ride, and they're going to be bored. Again, this is a drama, and one that I wanted to like more than I did. This doesn't sour me on Dev at all. He may have just bit off more than he could chew with this one, but he had the balls to go for it, and I respect that.",2024-04-06,0,0,624,0.9969,positive,0.734,
6,imdb,leestoych,7.0,"7 / 10 🔥Indian John Wick🔥 ""Only God can forgive you now"" Man. What a wild ride. Violent, fast paced yet beautifully shot. Great effort by Dev Patel on his directorial debut. He has managed to create a worthwhile action film with some great set pieces, neck, breaking stunts and an overall good looking film. I think what triumphs the most is the fast pace, headache inducing editing (this is a positive) with some great colour schemes and set pieces. It's fast paced editing matched the chaotic streets of India, mixed with its rich culture and history. The soundtrack was reminiscent of John Wick, with it's party scenes and colour palette. There was some great cinematography, especially through its use of silhouettes towards the final act. You can see the directors, aim to portray the monkey man, as a legendary figure who supports the powerless, and the impoverished of India's lower class. He makes a stand against those who are in control, which is a great pairing for an action/revenge film. I will say that the second act does falter a bit in its speed and does drag down in some places however, it quickly picks up pace again in the last act where monkey man turns into a proper beast. You can see the message the director portrayed as he highlights the inequality surrounding the poor in India and uses this medium to show that there is hope and people willing to make a stand against those who are in control. All in all a decent action film with great choreography, stunts, soundtrack and editing. This is an enjoyable watch, but doesn't elevate much further than your standard action flick.

6,imdb,krv1985,7.0,"7 / 10 A Stylish action flick that falls short on story depth Monkey Man is a watchable action flick that lacks depth in its storytelling. Set in India, the narrative revolves around religious beliefs and addresses issues surrounding godmen and their false prophecies. While the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and a treat for action movie lovers, the story fails to delve deeply into the themes it touches on. As a result, I couldn't emotionally connect with the main character, played by Dev Patel. The plot ultimately feels like a typical revenge tale. Although the filmmakers seem to draw inspiration from John Wick, they fall short of fully replicating its impact. That said, I appreciate how the movie highlights significant issues, such as the exploitation of religious beliefs by godmen, the politics around them, the land encroachment affecting the poor, and other social concerns. The visuals are stunning, and Dev Patel delivers a commendable performance, though there's little scope for other actors to shine. On the bright side, the movie is engaging from start to finish without any lags. Overall, it's a decent one-time watch for action enthusiasts.",2024-11-19,0,0,189,0.972,positive,0.795,

6,imdb,LeAvantGuardian,7.0,"7 / 10 Monkey Marathon Revenge movies being incredible or forgettable boils down to two factors. The quality of the action choreography and original fight scenes, and the ratio of backstory/reason for revenge to actually getting revenge. What made John Wick the pinnacle of revenge movies is how they masterfully build a world during action sequences, spending only the first 1% of the movie establishing his reason for revenge and then taking you for a thrill ride of artfully choreographed violence. Monkey Man sadly is not the Indian John Wick because where John wick does more with very little, Monkey Man conversely takes the opposite approach essentially dividing the film into two acts. The first half of the movie, roughly accounting for 65% of the duration of the 2 hour film consists of backstory, reason for revenge, and without spoiling anything, setbacks. A successful revenge movie understands that pacing is the sharpest blade. There may be setbacks. But they don't set back the pace as the movie always inches forward towards revenge. While it is true that it is possible to enhance the satisfaction of revenge by focusing more on the reason for that revenge, this is extremely difficult to do and in almost all cases ends up causing the movie to drag. This was very much the case with Monkey Man, or as my title refers to it - Monkey Marathon. Monkey Man has elements of what it needs to be to achieve a John Wick level of action film, but it goes in the completely wrong direction. Long form story telling. Drags. The whole first act drags and doesn't need to. 78%",2024-04-05,0,0,274,-0.986,negative,0.8,

For me this is primarily for one reason. The action was so poorly shot which is such an unforgivable sin for me. It was full of jarring cuts, shaky camera work, and disorientating pans and whips. Dev Patel clearly wanted a very kinetic and vibrant approach but it just wasn't executed well for me. This is such a shame as when the camera work did settle down the action was violent and gritty and could have been something really special. The stunt work all looked good, it just wasn't presented well at all. In terms of the story there isn't much to complain about. I've seen so many films of this ilk and Monkey Man doesn't necessarily stand out too much. Some side plots and characters added a little variety, but ultimately the story was fairly generic. Nothing great but nothing awful. Then there was the lead performance from Dev Patel which again I was left a tad underwhelmed by. He's a brilliant actor and considering he was directing I thought he'd really shine in this project, but he just failed to really draw me in as something was missing from his performance. None of the other characters were developed enough to particularly comment on their performances. One of the strengths of the film though is probably the look of the whole thing. There are some good creative choices in the sets, lighting etc, that do create a vibrancy and energy which worked well. With so many great films in this genre like John Wick, Taken, Nobody etc, there needed to be something in this film to really stand out.

6,imdb,LeonardoOliva69,6.0,"6 / 10 India's John Wick falls somewhere between an action film and a social outcry. This movie generated a lot of intrigue for me. I saw it particularly late and not when it was released and I had heard good reviews. They have called it ""John Wick"" from India and not in vain, since the movie itself makes fun of that during its course. However, I think it is a little more than hits and more hits as happens in the Keanu Reeves saga. Is that good? Maybe there is something wrong with it? Yes, too, because it seems to me that Dev Patel is too ambitious in this feature film. At times it has a frenetic pace, with excellent choreography despite the low budget compared to other productions. Patel himself, who we remember more for ""Skins"" or ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has a great display and shows off his handling of martial arts. At other times the movie becomes slow and pretentious, trying to give a socio-political-cultural context to the plot that I think harms it. This mix of plots creates a clear division in the film. On the one hand, Monkey Man is the action film, and on the other, the social denunciation of what is happening in India. For me, in particular, it didn't work.

There was potential here due to an engaging origin story which could have been a quality setup for a vigilante revenge hero movie but it wanes fast. The directing was terrible. The pace and sequencing was frustrating and annoying. The use of constant flash backs that could have been done in one opening scene, disjointed nonsensical illogical jump cuts, a worthless training montage and unnecessary underground criminal network scenes made this movie feel amateurish and insults the audience's intelligence. The enemies were generic epitomes of evil with constant scowls, menacing stares and lacking any good qualities. I didn't have any emotional attachment to the characters.

First the good bits: -Story was OK, nice to mix it in with excluded and socio-economic divided groups in India. Nothing amazing/original here and it had some holes. -Acting was perfunctory, nothing stand out great and nothing atrocious. -Violence, on occasion there was some well shot satisfying violence. Now the bad bits: -All of the unrelenting shaky cam, absolutely no need for all of it. I almost walked out in the second act because of it and I've never walked out of a cinema. They tried to do longer type shots for the action especially in the final act with less shaky cam, but still not shot well. -Really, really too many out of focus shots, either the cameraman was really inexperienced or they had too much really bad stylistic advice. Really distracting and really frustrating (just like my overuse of ""really"") -Almost constant poor framing of shots. Nothing was easy to watch and fortunately once shot every few minutes was OK to give my eyes a rest. Not sure if they bothered checking the cinematographer's CV before they hired him. Surely they had one, right? -The action, I love action films especially gritty, realistic, violent ones where the choreography has to be sharp and flow. This wasn't bad by any means but completely forgettable and shot appallingly compared to any of the films mentioned above. Dev Patel was OK, but a couple of times he was waiting for a punch and just out of the rhythm of it.

7,imdb,LordManhattan,7.0,"7 / 10 A lot of content, not a lot of substance First of, Gold is better than its IMDb rating and meta-score. I feel this movie is a victim of the studio going wild with a pair of scissors, trying to make it short(er) (even at 2 hours) to please the mainstream audience, but while doing that, this movie loses a lot of substance. Character development is lacking, apart from our protagonist, so it doesn't really feel like we get to know them. One moment we have a new (seemingly an important) character, and then he or she will either disappear or roam in the background. I guess that happens when you start cutting. I suspect there's a great version of this movie out there, and I'd rather watch a 3 hour version with everything included, than this. The movie also takes place in the late 80's(?) or early 90's, but I don't feel like time was important here, which makes things a little confusing. I have no idea if they've been at something for a week, a month, or five years. The whole movie also feels a little rushed in the sense that it tries to get to the end as quickly as possible. It lacks the details; Slow down a little, speak to us, breathe. I want to know more, I want to see more, but it ends up being a National Geographic article instead of a book.

7,imdb,rubenm,7.0,"7 / 10 Capitalist adventure movie Essentially, 'Gold' is an old fashioned adventure movie. A hostile environment, changing fortunes, shifting alliances, unexpected adversaries, a seemingly betrayed friendship: it's all there. But the setting is out of the ordinary: it's the financial world with millions of dollars pumped into promising mining stocks. But those millions can just as quickly be withdrawn when the prospects change. The adventurer in the midst of it all is Kenny Wells, son of a Nevada gold prospector and heir to an almost bankrupt mining company. In an all-or-nothing attempt, he travels to Indonesia for a meeting with a legendary drilling expert. The next step is to find the money required for the drilling. What follows, is a roller-coaster ride of successes and setbacks. Matthew McConaughey is amazing as Kenny Wells, a raving maniac with a fearless can-do mentality and a complete lack of respect for Wall Street hotshots or mining moguls. This is one of his best roles ever, and it's worth an Oscar. You can see the doubt in the eyes of everyone he meets: is this a madman who doesn't know what he's up to, or a go-getter who doesn't give up until he reaches his goal? Wells is both, and McConaughey makes his complex character completely believable. There are some extra layers in the story underlining this complexity: the relationship with his wife Kay, and the friendship with his business partner Mike Acosta. The latter is responsible for the spectacular ending of the story, with a really nice surprise in the last seconds. The whole story is based on the Bre-X scandal, which hit the worldwide headlines in the nineties. Some details are changed, but on the whole the story follows the real events pretty accurate. The scandal was a prime example of excessive capitalist greed, and the film is a nice reminder of it.",2017-04-08,0,0,312,0.9913,positive,0.733,

He's a lifelong wildcat prospector working for his respected father until his sudden death. With nothing left in business, he goes to Indonesia and connects with geologist Michael Acosta (Édgar Ramírez) who has a revolutionary theory. They head into the jungle and become gold mining legends. I do remember Bre-X. Some of it came back to me along with the movie. I remember one of the reporters telling the story of a souvenir core sample. They handed out samples to reporters and investors. As the scandal broke, they went back to test those samples. I think there is a missing character. It needs an investigative reporter who uncovers the scandal. Kenny and Kay's breakup seems abrupt. The second half seems a bit rushed although the two hour running time probably forced some cutting. McConaughey may be trying too hard shooting for an award.

7,imdb,eddie_baggins,6.0,"6 / 10 Another notable McConaughey turn can't save this drama A few years ago a performance like the one Matthew McConaughey delivers here in Stephen Gaghan's based on a true tale Gold would've created quite a stir. It's a credit to the actor, who resurrected his career from the doldrums of so-so romcoms, Surfer Dudes and other forgettable affairs to all of a sudden become an Oscar winning and HBO headlining legend but with that career revival has come an expectation that McConaughey going method and fully inhabiting his characters is the normal and therefore less of an event that it was, a mere few years ago. No more so evident than in the fact Gold came and disappeared with very little fanfare in the awards season rush at the end of 2016, McConaughey chewing up the scenery wasn't enough to draw people into the cinemas, as the beer bellied, hair thinning and sweaty thespian found himself being the best thing about a so-so film that never feels completely assured of itself. Telling the rather complex story of struggling 1980's American prospector/mining magnate Kenny Wells, who found fame and wealth by teaming up with prospecting master Michael Acosta in the jungles of Indonesia, Syriana director and Traffic screenwriter Stephen Gaghan never pieces together the many various elements of Well's story into a satisfactory whole as events come and go and Well's journey takes its twists and turns. As is with any film in the vein of Gold, it's always a fine balance for a filmmaker to strike the perfect line between pandering to an audience or keeping them in the dark and unfortunately for Gold there ends up being too many times where we're left in the lurch a little by the plights affecting Well's while some scenes in the film that feel hugely important to the whole scheme of things, often feel underutilised or passed over which leaves the trials and adversities of this American mogul emotionally unengaging. What can't be denied in the film however is the aforementioned work of McConaughey, who's a joy to watch as Wells, the car crash waiting to happen. In a loaded cast that includes an underused Bryce Dallas Howard as Well's long-suffering girlfriend Kay, Edgar Ramirez as Acosta, Corey Stoll as Wall Street player Brian Woolf and Toby (needs a new agent) Kebbell as FBI investigator Paul Jennings, McConaughey stands head and shoulders above the rest and while its far from his best turn over recent years, it's a quality actor that can deliver such above average performances on cue, as McConaughey does here. Sometimes clad in nothing more than some worn-out white underpants or looking dishevelled beyond belief, McConaughey's turn as Well's deserves a better film and showcases what might've been for Gold had it managed to match the chaotic nature of its main character and the commitment of its on form leading man. Final say – Digging up another memorable McConaughey turn, Gold doesn't strike it rich due to tonal issues and a lack of emotional engagement but Gaghan's slightly disappointing film is still an often intriguing true story made all the better by the work of its leading man. 3 pot bellies out of 5",2017-06-13,0,0,537,0.9909,positive,0.805,

7,imdb,Top_Dawg_Critic,8.0,"8 / 10 Editing issues? I am shocked at the low IMDb score for this movie as I enjoyed every aspect of it... the acting, directing, cinematography etc 'except' for the editing (sound and cutting room). The problem started with the very choppy scene changes and the cut- short dialogue. There were too many back and forth timeline changes and they were very poorly transitioned. What I really question is how the synopsis has much more information than what was in the film. Did that viewer see a different extended version of the movie I just watched? Don't get me wrong, it really filled in a lot of gaps that otherwise wouldn't have been filled in for me to truly understand certain parts and fully enjoy the movie. Every 30 min or so I'd go catch up on the synopsis before continuing the movie and it really did help. I also had a very difficult time understanding the dialogue as it was either too low or too muffled (or Matthew was whispering too low). So although I really did enjoy this movie, I felt a lot of key parts ended up on the cutting room floor that thankfully the synopsis filled in, and the sound (dialogue) needed some tweaking to be more understandable. 7.5/10 rounded up to 8 for the current undeserving low score.",2017-02-10,0,0,224,0.5818,positive,0.81,

If this movie was put forward in this year's Oscar's, portraying Gold prospector Kenny Wells, I have no doubt Matthew would have won best actor, hands down! The movie itself was fantastically shot with amazing props and costumes representing the 80's era perfectly. Something else that caught my ears was the amazing soundtrack. Not the normal songs you would hear from an 80's era movie, by a very alternative soundtrack. Artists like Iggy Pop, Joy Division and The Pixies, just to name a few. The movie itself..watching it I had this feeling of gunning for the underdog in the big world of stocks and commodities, however the film never really delved deep into the impact of what these companies have on the smaller communities, which is obviously a deliberate path...definitely worth a watch and if you had any doubt of McConaugheys acting...just watch this.",2017-04-23,0,0,195,0.9895,positive,0.793,

7,imdb,trublu215,5.0,"5 / 10 Entertaining Yet Uninspired. Gold is, by far, the oddest film of the Oscar season. It's not good enough to be featured with some other award-based films yet it is far from being a bad film. It's just a very uninspired piece of filmmaking that had an excellent script and a great cast to it, yet no flavor to the filmmaking here. It is a standardized piece that serves as a lackluster love letter to Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell without ever really admitting it. Majority of this film is spent watching McCounaughey's Kenny Wells as he maneuvers through businessmen that want him to be put down, political groups that want to steal his fortune and friends he can barely trust. It sounds like an amazing film and it could have been had Gaghan not directed this film himself. Every frame that passes, it feels like Gaghan was either worried about feeling too much like Scorsese or worried that it wasn't enough like Scorsese. Either way, we know where his influences lie here. Honestly, you're better off watching The Wolf of Wall Street, if you're hoping for something like that. Stephen Gaghan is a very talented writer, he's given us very layered stories with very interesting characters but this particular topic feels like it went over his head. It is never engaging enough to sustain lasting power. McConaughey and the rest of the cast do a fine job, nothing outstanding but fine nonetheless. This was probably the most disappointing part of this film. Over the past 5 years, Matthew McConaughey has given us more than enough reason to love his performances. They're layered, they're relate-able and, most of all, they're acted to perfection. This performance, in which he trades in his slim physique for a bloated, overweight and balding man. Right off the bat, this may have been a physically demanding role for McConaughey and he does put his all into his performance but it still doesn't match the caliber of his previous performances. His dedication is clear but it still didn't feel like the great performance we thought he could give in this film which comes back to the issue of Gaghan's direction. Overall, Gold is far from a bad movie. There are cool scenes in it that are bound to interest you even if it's for a little bit. But this is a film that comes down to a problem with the director. Gaghan, while being a very talented writer, has a hard time determining his own vision for a film that had many chances to be great but failed to really capitalize on any of its strengths. By the end of the film, you won't feel cheated out of your ticket money but I'm sure you won't feel all that good about it either.",2016-12-31,0,0,470,0.9916,positive,0.742,

7,imdb,Spinetinglers-UK,7.0,"7 / 10 McConaughey is the glitter in a film without much gold Longing for the American dream should never be inextricable from the determination of an individual. Dreaming about achieving a goal should go hand in hand with proactively doing it. Without veering off on a transcendentalist tangent, let me introduce Kenny Wells. Wells is a pot-bellied, greased up chain smoking alcoholic, perhaps uncomfortably seen as the heir to the throne of the Washoe Mining Company based in 'the biggest little city in the world' and where Johnny Cash sang of a prisoner shooting a man, 'just to watch him die'. The one and only, Reno, Nevada. So maybe I haven't painted Wells in such a great light so far. He certainly isn't the godchild of Emerson, but that's what director Stephen Gaghan appears to try and convey. This is Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey as you've never witnessed before, presented in a way that's far from an idealised sharp-suited image of the American dreamer and stoically opposed to Ron Woodward's skeletal frame in his winning performance in 2013's 'Dallas Buyers Club'. However, he's the film's gleaming treasure in a somewhat clichéd quest for glory, even if the main aesthetic shine is only from his forehead in an Indonesian jungle. 'Gold' is loosely based upon the Bre-X mining scandal of 1993 with Gaghan confusingly transporting us straight back to the 1980s to a world of questionable suits, post-punk, Iggy Pop and the romantic aspirations of Wells. His journey is somewhat instigated by the death of his father, luring him further into the volatile and unpredictable world of gold mining, conducting the train through its successes and abrupt halts. From the smoky testosterone filled bars of Reno to the sweat inducing tropics of Borneo, we realise how integral McConaughey's performance is to the success and believability of the narrative. Although somewhat charismatic through his wittiness and general naivety to the overall project, Kenny Wells is a man who is out to make money. Wells' sidekick, geologist Michael Acosta (Edgar Ramirez), is bestowed with elements of morality and spirituality, clearly seen in his proactive interaction with the Indonesian people. So therefore, Wells' financial determination combined with Acosta's endearing qualities and intelligence make the relationship such a strong focal point of the film. The strength of the characters makes the adventure seem almost tangible, yet still questionable. Looking at McConaughey's transformation, you may just begin to question how Kaylene (Bryce Dallas-Howard) has fallen for such a downtrodden hopeless wanderer. However it's her innocent undying belief in him that makes Wells' decline even more forceful. There is an essence of the childhood sweetheart in her demeanour, the archetypal support mechanism to Kenny's weaknesses. Yes, she rides on the wave of success to its highest heights with Wells, lavishing herself in material riches but in a way, she is the moral spine of the film, never losing sight of the real Kenny Wells she's grown up loving. Kaylene acts just as much as the voice of reason as Michael Acosta and it is the combination of powerful relationships that we will really take away from the screen. The dizzying heights of financial success ultimately lead to a strenuous, yet somewhat predictable breakdown between Kenny and Kaylene and we can't help but feel like she is completely unworthy of any of it. Whiskey plus money plus the inability to maintain your dignity . Well you know the rest. That's not saying Kenny Wells is a vile person, despite his, for want of a better term, shabby look. We're willing everything to work out for both of them, yet the American dream just becomes too much to handle. McConaughey's character compared to the regimental sharp suited Wall Street bankers is a deliberate contrast by Gaghan. Our willingness for the sugar coated American dream to work out is pitted against the cold-hearted capitalist intentions of Brian (Corey Stoll). Wells' resilience to counteract an offer made by Stoll and his legion of top button fastened, tight tied troubadours, can only be admired. The ambition to fight against globalisation, to hold onto your dreams, to recapture lost determination and to let nothing stand in your way in fighting for what you want, is made believable through McConaughey's stellar performance. However, in what should be an adventure full of undying speed to keep up with the lustful desire for success, the film's narrative is too slow to match the pace of Wells' dreams.

There are periods that are bordering on cringe-worthy, some dialogue that is bland and uninspired, and some pretentious moments where the film acts as if it's Best Picture worthy at the Academy Awards. Conversely, there are some very good scenes at times, and an ending that certainly gives the film a lot more weight. There were two writers for this film and it almost feels like one would write one scene while the other would write another section of the movie altogether, both with varying degrees of quality. This was an interesting role for Matthew McConaughey. We know he's tried to achieve a make-over of his career, and has done a very good job of it. Gone are the days where he was simply showing up to be the charming guy in a lifeless script and collect a paycheck. Still here, I didn't think he was quite at his best. To be fair some of the dialogue he had to deliver was pretty terribly written and would have been difficult for anyone to pull off. Even still, his performance just felt a little off to me. It's hard to judge an inconsistent film. Overall I'd say it leans more towards being a badly made film than a good one. There was a story to be told here (it's based on a true story), but I just think the way they structured it left a little to be desired.

The mystery of his ability is different from other actors. He looks, talks and seems very much the same in all his roles, yet somehow makes you believe he is that person. Bryce Howard also gives a good performance. Her physical appearance is trans-formative, and you clearly would never recognize her. This movie combined the elements of a treasure hunt, and the allure and adventure of the find, with a corporate thriller. Realism, however, prevents me from going higher. I'm already stretching it with rating it an 8. The strange ups and downs that happened, along with the not so surprise of an ending, is the stretch that leaves it at the 8 point.

9,imdb,Kevin-42,,"You know that a movie is good when you leave it asking yourself ""Why haven't I heard of this before?"" 1980. The movie starts harmless. A widowed taxi driver in Seoul struggling to make ends meet for himself and his little daughter. He more or less wants to do the right thing in a country where circumstances aren't all that well but you can live your life. The movie pulls a few heartstrings here and there but never too much. It is surprisingly tactful and the director wisely steps back from the story and lets good actors paint a picture of everyday life. Enter a German reporter who smells a good story after being tipped off by a BBC colleague who tells him that the generally tense situation in South Korea somehow got worse recently. He needs a driver and the taxi driver needs the money. It is a relation out of necessity and neither of them actually seem to take a liking to each other. Both soon have to come to terms with the fact that they put themselves into a situation which has great relevance to their country and their professions. Turning away just isn't possible. ""Doing the right thing"" means that an average person has to find extraordinary courage. I have to commend the director and his actors for this eyewitness feeling. It is almost like you're another passenger sitting in that little taxi. You don't watch a movie but you are actually there as it happens. The fact that I was largely ignorant of those events in history makes this movie even more significant. The end result is a movie which is well-directed, with competent acting and impressive camera work. I had very little to criticize but a lot to think about when I left the show and that -to me- often is the sign of a truly good movie. Go see it!",2017-11-11,0,0,317,0.9908,positive,0.792,

9,imdb,niels2765,7.0,"7 / 10 Riddled with cliches, but too much talent to be unenjoyable. Jang Hun studies the dynamic of Kim Man-Seob (Kang-ho Song) and Jürgen Hinzpeter (Thomas Kretschmann) in his film A Taxi Driver (2017) which unfolds in a neglected and unkempt Gwangju in the 1980s. A hefty and charismatic performance from Kang-ho Song is profoundly important in this film, a film in which, despite its many flaws, thrives on its character development and technical triumphs to create a conclusively delectable watch. We are in South Korea in the 1980s, as an uprising takes place in Gwangju, which the general population of South Korea is oblivious to and uninformed about. We are introduced to a taxi driver by the name of Kim Man-Seob, living in Seoul, who juggles his problems one at a time, struggling to pay his rent and to keep his daughter pleased. When eating lunch at a canteen, he overhears a topic of conversation between two other taxi drivers, about a German willing to pay 100,000 won to drive him to Gwangju, deaf to the mutiny taking place in Gwangju, Kim strikes up a plan to steal this client. The German, is a journalist by the name of Jürgen Hinzpeter, due to the restrictions implemented by the government, Jürgen pretends to be a Christian missionary. After being picked up by Kim, they leave for Gwangju. After an altercation with government troops, Kim and Jürgen get into Gwangju, rampage ensues, as we follow these two characters in the Gwangju uprising, and their struggle to document, escape and help Gwangju. Jang Hun manipulates the audience into instantly sympathizing with Kim Man-Seob when developing his background, Jang Hun inserts exposition explaining why we should commiserate with Kim. Kang-Ho Song delivers an impeccable performance that eclipses the other performances. Kang-Ho Song, who has already established himself as a luminous, grade-A actor, has once again proven the degree wherein his acting can go to. Despite the film being based on the Gwangju uprising, the Director took it upon himself to change the story, most likely to make the story more cinematic and commercial. Jang Hun over exaggerates certain character motives and actions. Irrational behaviour and the consistency of a character's persona throughout the film shapes a supposition that it was lazily written. Riddled with discernable cliches and glaring plot holes, the writing seems to focus only on developing Kim, and doesn't develop Jürgen. Often this wouldn't be an issue, but given the amount of screen time the character receives, it is unfair for the audience to be unable to relate and sympathize with him. Side characters such as Gu Jae-sik and Hwang Tae-sul are better developed than Jürgen. The film has outstanding production design by Yi-jin Jeong, who creates monumental period cityscape images of Gwangju and encapsulates the feeling of 1980 Gwangju faultlessly. The film is well-paced, thanks to the quick-cut editing from Jae-beom Kim and Sang-beom Kim. The tonal shifts throughout could've come across as jarring, but due to the skilful editing, the tonal shifts are smooth. The quick pacing fit the story well, as the story was anxiety-inducing. The music score, composed by Young-wook Jo accentuates this anxious feeling throughout the film, and it is extremely commendable what a sensational job he has done. He has created built up instrumentals that offer an everlasting apprehensive experience for the audience. The cinematography throughout is noticeably innovative, beautifully constructed camera movements, inventive dialogue shots, and brilliantly justified hand-held shots. The cinematography compliments the lighting, as they come hand in hand. The lighting subconsciously brings out angst. The film is often gorgeously lit and utilizes natural light flawlessly. The niche colour palette is bright and vibrant which clashes in contrast to the harsh subject matter emphasizes the hope and faith of the character's we are following. The frame composition is expertly done and occasionally helps carry the story on visually. Jang Hun has dealt with the subject matter competently, where it is safe and inoffensive, he's directed a technically-innovative film, in specific regards to the impeccably shot action sequences. The film fails on a story-telling front, often melodramatic and riddled with painstaking cliches, as well as has multiple plot devices to give an excuse to some of the ridiculous plotlines. It is easy to overlook these issues due to the sheer effort and talent behind this film. Predominantly enjoyable, A Taxi Driver is often unrealistic in what we see on screen but does just enough for a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",2020-03-27,0,0,747,0.9987,positive,0.768,

The film may also be relevant today in the US, when tensions between people and the government over the needless deaths of individuals at the hands of police officers have caused major riots and protests across the country. This film begs the question of credibility in what the government tells it's people. While traveling in South Korea, I practically stumbled across the memorial in Gwang-ju, and was amazed to find that it happened so recently. Young people NEED to know that stuff like this still happens, that it's not simply dates we read about in ""ancient"" history. Please do not let the gore and brutality of the film deter you from watching. It is that way for a reason. The reality of our world is bloody and cruel, but this film also gives us a glimpse of hope; that there are some willing to give there lives for a just cause, and through the perspective of these characters, we are carried through an amazingly heartfelt film-watching experience.",2020-07-19,0,0,235,0.6664,positive,0.854,
9,imdb,valentinvolland,7.0,"7 / 10 Good but long dramatised version of a crucial point in South Korean history This South Korean film is a fictionalised view into the experiences of german reporter Jürgen Hinzpeter (who died in 2016) and driver Kim Sa-bok (unkown to the public) at the Gwangju uprising in 1980. The filmmakers tried to identify Kim Sa-bok prior to the production, but only after the films release it has surfaced that the man had died of cancer in 1984, four years after the events in the film. Knowing nearly nothing about the driver, the filmmaker tried their best to create an intruiging character, that fit the movie. The actor Song Kang-ho as well as his german counterpart Thomas Kretschmann both did great jobs and I liked their performances. The screenplay/plot is not too bad, it does a good job being both entertaining and sometimes even light-hearted, as well as handling the though and serious topic of the gwangju uprising very well. However the pacing of the movie isn't absolutely great, with the rythm of the film sometimes a bit off, so it could have also been a little shorter than 135 min. Another problem was, that although I know about the history, for me personally this tragedy hasn't been translated well enough onto the movie. Objectively they handeled the tragedy well, but I was left a little bit cold. That being said I did enjoy the film and would rate it 7.5 if i could.",2018-05-14,0,0,245,0.6654,positive,0.709,

Chances are you can think of a few timeless ones that stand the test of time (perhaps 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' 'A Few Good Men,' 'The Pelican Brief'). In Justine Triet's 'Anatomy of a Fall,' we can get to see the French judicial system on display in a tale of the struggle to decide when it's difficult to see the truth through a forest of hearsay. There are a few aspects of 'Fall' that hold the audience's attention more so than other films in this genre. The way the story unfolds from the initial events to the verdict and aftermath is riveting, which makes it easy to understand how it earned an Oscar for best original screenplay. The performance of Sandra Hüller is exceptional, as she convincingly plays a conflicted writer who loves her half-blind son, Daniel (Milo Machado-Graner), yet must defend herself against an accusation of murder. There are a few scenes in 'Fall' that are masterclass, including the recreation of an argument between Hüller and her onscreen husband, Samuel Maleski (Samuel Theis). This scene is intense, agonizing and feels completely authentic, and both actors deliver A+ work. Machado-Graner also does a superb job across the board, including an emotional testimony as a witness in the trial. Oh, and anyone who watches this movie will never be able to think of 50 Cent's ""P.

The film refuses to answer the question of guilt or innocence, but rather examines how people construct their own narratives based on partial and biased information. The film shows how gender, media, and personal motives influence the interpretation of the facts. The son of the accused, who is the only witness, admits that he does not know what really happened, and that he has to make a choice about what to believe. The prosecutor, who seems to have a personal vendetta against the accused, also relies on assumptions and speculations rather than solid evidence.

I have never been a fancier of Courtroom dramas, not that I straight up renounce them, I do like to attend to some if their stories exude enough flavour but that is rare and happens in selective instances. You must be wondering, how did I end up here then? Well, I thought the courtroom aspect would just be a part of the narrative, not the primary focus, but as you can tell I was terribly mistaken, had I known it prior, I would have set my expectations accordingly. Nevertheless, despite the script's earnest insistence on encouraging socially relevant discussion regarding Marital Issues and power dynamics in a relationship, most of it appeared surface level, lacking depth and substance, at least not on par with the promises that were set in the initial stage.

8,imdb,arungeorge13,8.0,"8 / 10 A (crime?) drama of the finest quality! [+83%] The beauty of the film truly lies in how delicately it's paced throughout. Even when it takes the shape of a courtroom drama with great attention to detail, it still rests firmly on the emotional bonding between the lead characters - in this case, a mother (Sandra), her son (Daniel), and their dog. That never takes a backseat, despite the film turning into a murder mystery (of sorts) at several points. I absolutely loved the performances here, be it Sandra Hüller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado Graner, and Samuel Theis. And for all it's worth, the standout here is Snoop (the dog), and his presence not only drives the story forward at a pivotal juncture, but this wonderful canine also takes the audience's perspective in the beginning and at the end of the film. He's travelling with these characters just like us, while also playing the role of an unconditional guardian angel to Daniel. When the writing digs deep into the intricacies of a marriage, it is poignant, relatable, and hard-hitting. Both the husband and the wife are writers essentially, and that makes their struggles and little victories all the more accessible. The changing dynamics in their relationship is brought to light through superbly shot flashbacks (just as their audio recordings are being played in court), and we as audiences, understand what each half of the couple is going through. The journey is dramatic alright, but since the outcome determines whether the mother gets to reunite with her son after a long, drawn-out trial, it always remains riveting to watch. The ""lesser"" moments - like a scene that depicts Sandra and her lawyer friend drinking together, are also beautifully staged.",2023-10-14,0,0,290,0.9858,positive,0.83,

Excellently directed with the best handling of the shots and the cameras of the year. The acting of Sandra Huller and the boy (whose name I'm forgetting) are impressive, worthy of award nominations. Not in vain the actress was in two of the best movies of the year. Her handling of languages and how she makes each dialogue credible is fascinating.

Sadly, it didn't deliver. I support the message that people's relations are too complex to be easily judged and Hüller's performance is masterful, but it's not enough to save it all. The story is quite standard (with the addition of the obligatory non-traditional roles and sexualities), so we have two and a half hours to dedicate fully to the psychological depths. There is only a brush on the surface though. The kid character is unnecessary and unbelievable: he is allowed and able to make a philosophical argument in a courtroom, for crying out loud. I would never say ""no"" to a dog, but the truth is we don't need it either.

8,imdb,MogwaiMovieReviews,5.0,"5 / 10 A clumsy, overlong and frustratingly insubstantial film with good performances Watched this recent French film last night; the winner of this year's Palme d'Or, which says something about the level of competition in the world of film today. It's an excellently acted and well-shot story of a wife on trial for the possible murder of her husband, who is found fallen from the highest window of their alpine home, but at 2½ hours, it's a good 40 or 50 minutes too long for such a small and relatively simple tale. There are endless courtroom scenes that don't progress the narrative or lead to any shocking twists, which could have easily been compressed or pared down in more competent hands. It's an extremely - and frustratingly - female film, in its wallowing in subjectivity and its repeated assertion that what one feels is actual reality, rather than the facts of the matter, and as a result, there is no clear ending to the film, the message being that you can choose to believe whatever the hell you like. But of course this is silly nonsense: either one human being pushed another human being out of a window or they didn't, and in a murder trial, that should be all that matters. So yes, it's a strange thing to rate: on a moment-by-moment basis, it's well-observed and often engrossing, but the substance of the story itself is flimsy and, in the final analysis, almost non-existent, so the most I can generously give it is 6/10.",2023-12-15,0,0,256,-0.9126,negative,0.768,

In fact, I was challenged to do the work along with the jury and perceive exactly what Daniel felt. This film's realism really connected with me. It was so accurate and stressful that I forgot I was watching a film. I felt like I was watching a true story or the news or something. That is why it was very skillfully executed and well acted, as we have seen a brilliant performance from the leading actress, Sandra Hüller, who convincingly conveyed a dynamic variety of emotions.

8,imdb,MattyLuke-81663,8.0,"8 / 10 LIFF37 2023 #2 Anatomy of a Fall is a clever and compelling drama about a woman who must prove her innocence after the unexpected death of her husband. It's not quite a mystery/why whodunnit, or a full-blown courtroom drama. And it's not a foreign movie either, as it slips in and out of English and French. It's a movie about the complications of a situation and the language barrier to get information across, both literal, as our main character has some trouble speaking French, as she is originally from Germany, and metaphorical with trying to communicate what we are feeling and saying to people who don't seem to listen. We slowly learn what type of relationship it was between her and her husband during the trial, as she shares personal information to prove her innocence or a secretly recorded audio during a heated moment that gives you a better idea of their relationship. Sandra Hüller's performance was fantastic, and her character is complex. One scene is when she delivers a fiery monologue, and it holds you in your place. I was unaware of her work beforehand, but after this film - she is on my radar. I cannot wait to see her in the Auschwitz film The Zone of Interest. There is a stellar child performance from Milo Machado Graner and a challenging part, especially for his age, but he blew me away. The final speech he delivers towards the end is both beautiful and devastating. All the acting from the cast was superb. Even the family dog was fantastic. The directing and camera work was superb, and every shot was well thought out and presented effectively. The script was tremendous, as the dialogue and plot were terrific, but it also gave the actors a lot to work with. My only issue with the film is the courtroom stuff, which slowed the pacing. While those scenes weren't awful, they just got repetitive after a while. Overall rating: Anatomy of a Fall is a gripping drama that keeps you guessing.

Gamer Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo supremo gets the chance to compete for a chance at the big time, a chance at The Nissan GT Academy, and subsequently a shot at winning a contract with Nissan racing. To say this is as far off my type of movie as possible is an understatement, I stood out at the cinema like a sore thumb, I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I have to say it, it's a very good movie. If you're expecting Fast and Furious, don't, sure it's full of speed and it's high octane, but it's more a triumph against the odds sort of story, with Jann the central character, a guy from Wales, taking on the elite at their own game, in what is an elite sport. Jann faces challenge after challenge, and just when you think he's succeeded, he's thrown another curve ball. Some very good use of special effects, the crash scenes in particular look amazingly realistic. There's also some wonderful location work too, they really did make use of several world-wide locations. Archie Madekwe does a great job as Jann, he puts in an excellent performance, you really do see the young man develop and grow through the film. Always good to see Bloom, and he played the part well, David Harbour was excellent I thought, he added a lot to the overall story. Is this the most random soundtrack ever, I never thought Kenny G, Black Sabbath and Enya would feature together in the same cinema, let alone the same movie. I never thought I'd welling up over a bluebird, but there you have it, there were one of two very touching scenes.

Unlike its very bad marketing would have you believe this is a great watch with an engaging story, anger inducing antagonists and some amazing acting performances, David Harbour is especially good as Jan's main guy. Orlando Bloom was also very good and Archie Madekwe should Sue the trailer house for displaying his performance as anything other than stellar. The movie has some problems of course, some of the CGI is abysmal and feels like it was a mix of bad CGI and wanting to make it look like a video game at all times, and the end result is really distracting. Also the movie loves to just abandon characters that could really go somewhere. Overall though, it's a great watch and I would highly recommend you ignore the trailers (that give away a weird amount of the plot) and go watch this film.",2023-08-06,0,0,167,0.9235,positive,0.679,

To be honest, I expected something more akin to the cheesy Fast and Furious movies. I had set a very low bar of anticipation. With that in mind, the reality of this movie was an enormously pleasant surprise: a fascinating true life story that magnificently captured the adrenaline buzz and accomplishments of elite motorsport. The racing scenes, and there's a lot of them, were masterfully created. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. It was an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I was grinning with euphoria, then gripping my hands in fear, then I was giggling out loud with a happy release of nervous energy. Being a true life story, it couldn't be spoiled by poor plot writing. I loved the uplifting, feel-good, tale of the talented underdog risking all to achieve his dreams. Yet it wasn't a cliché because it was real; the movie had no sense of being formulaic or contrived. The acting was spot on, the characters perfectly well developed, and the special effects were both awe inspiring and seamless. The movie was enthralling from start to finish. It's absolutely a contender for being my favourite movie of the year. It's also one of my favourite motorsports movies of all time: and that's a compliment I don't give easily.

10,imdb,ethanbresnett,7.0,"7 / 10 An underdog story full of momentum Gran Turismo is a terrifically executed sports movie, fizzing with energy and momentum from start to finish. It follows the story of Jann Mardenborough, a gamer who always dreamed of becoming a professional racer. Thanks to the Gran Turismo academy he suddenly finds himself with a chance to make his dream a reality. It's a wild story and the fact that it is based on real events is astounding. Even though the real events are unbelievable, the story beats are all pretty familiar and follow the usual sports movie formula. There's the underdog, the jaded mentor, the belligerent rival, the customary montage. None of this is ground breaking but it is all well presented and packaged up. The fact it is based on real events adds that bit of extra excitement and besides, who doesn't love an underdog story? The direction from Blomkamp is crisp and clean yet also energetic and chaotic, which makes for a visually engaging film. You really feel the excitement and thrill and danger of the racing, which was crucial to establish and get across, and was handled well. In terms of performances, Archie Madekwe is a really solid lead, bringing a strong emotional presence and charisma to his character. David Harbour brings his character to life perfectly with a thoroughly engaging performance, and Djimon Hounsou is a scene stealer with some of the more emotional baggage. I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but I was impressed! It has an unbelievable story to tell and it does it very effectively. A lot of it feels quite derivative of the underdog sports film genre, but the great direction and solid performances raise this film up above many of its peers, resulting in a thoroughly entertaining movie.",2023-08-06,0,0,304,0.9954,positive,0.719,

For some perspective, I've never watched professional racing or played Gran Turismo. And I'm generally not a fan of based-on-true-story against-all-odds movies. They're usually all the same. The reason I say all this is to illustrate that the movie had to be really good to win me over. And it definitely does. Even though it goes through many of the same motions as these types of movies, it does it all so well. I was fully invested in the story, the characters and their outcomes. My crowd was really into it as well. I can't speak to how the movie translates the game, but they creatively incorporate some cool visuals. It helps it feel like a video game movie as opposed to a movie about a video game. The race scenes are awesome, you really feel like you're there. I like the cast, with the two leads being the obvious standouts. And there are some really heartfelt moments. I had a great time with Gran Turismo. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a premium screen (IMAX, Dolby Atmos, etc). I think most people will like it, gamer or not, race fan or not, old, young, etc. (1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 7/24/2023) As a side note, I'm really hoping we've turned a corner with video game movies, similar to what happened to super hero movies in the early 2000's. I really enjoyed Sonic 1 and 2, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie is in contention for my favorite movie of the year. There is still so much potential. If they continue down the super hero path, then someone like Christopher Nolan will take a property and show what can truly be done.

10,imdb,ma-cortes,6.0,"6 / 10 Un decent film based on a true story about the competitive world of real racing. Video games and car racing go hand in hand in this exciting film of dreams come true based on a true story of a Gran Turismo player who became a professional driver. Jann (Archie Madekwe) is an avid gamer from Cardiff who spends his days playing Gran Turismo, refusing to succeed in the real world. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Danny (Orlando Bloom), a marketing manager for the Nissan automobile corporation, is running an advertising campaign and, together with the management of Gran Turismo, hatches a plan to launch a competition inviting gamers to try their luck in real pulse-quickening car races. Needing help organizing an event, Danny turns to Jack Salter (David Harbor), a former racing driver to train the youngsters. The veteran driver will become the coach of the young promises with special attention to the training of Jann. The latter is based on a true character, in fact Jann Mardenborough plays a stunt double in the film for the actor who portrays himself. From gamer to racer !. This is a breathtaking film, inspiring true story of a peculiar team, following the famous video game franchise at the time, 'Gran Turismo', containing bravura, willpower love, redemption, and motor oil all swirled together. The picture mingles thrills, family drama, exciting car races, and spectacular sequences though won't mean much on little screen TV. It's a typical Blockbuster where reality , plot and dialog have their place, focusing on the drivers who challenge their contenders throughout the international and competitive racing circuits. This is an overwhelming picture with exceptionally fine camera work and great car races sequences and crashes on the circuits, tracks, and several other places. The drivers, the cars, the crashes are the real stars of this movie from the beginning to the end. Based on the unbelievable story, but plenty of clichés, about a a team of underdogs - a struggling, working-class gamer, a failed former race car driver, and an idealistic motorsport exec - who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world. The main and support cast are quite good, giving uniformly attractive performances: Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings, Pirates of The Caribbean) plays Danny Moore, a Nissan marketing executive who convinces the company to recruit players for the Gran Turismo simulator and transform them into real racing drivers. David Harbor (Stranger Things) is the expert pilot and trainer of the young boys, while Archie Madekwe (Midsommer) is real driver Jann Mardenborough, a Welsh Gran Turismo gamer eager to compete in authentic speed tests, he does impress again in the role of a brave young. Adding other nice secondaries, such as: Djimon Hounsou, pre-Spice Girls: Geri Halliwell , Takehiro Hira, Pepe Barroso, Josha Stradowski, Daniel Puig, among others. All stunts were performed by authentic experts without people damage . A majority of the car stunts in the film were done practically using car shells, and visual effects were widely used. And digital cars were also employed for significant crashes. Many of the film's racing sequences were shot with the Hungaroring, in Hungary, standing in for various different circuits. Most notably the Hungaroring stands in for Silverstone during the GT Academy sequences. The movie was well made by South African-Canadian film director and screenwriter Neill Blomkamp-. His first and best movie was the successful District 9 , however , being his producer Peter Jackson with his companies Weta Workshorp and Weta Digital that stole the show by means of the breathtaking visual effects, creatures , makeup , Animatrix design make the film results to be a groundbreaking spectacle. Neill Blomkamp is a nice craftsman who is known for the science fiction films District 9 , Elysium and Chappie . He also directed the Demonic and the 2007 short film Halo: Landfall, based on the Microsoft science fiction video game franchise. Rating Gran Turismo(2023): 6/10 .

Above anything, the races and camerawork are certainly the thing to watch it for. The human element reminded me of the people-plot on a Transformers movie.. it is intrinsically a part of it (and very necessary), but it is somewhat skippable, generic and dull. Buuut at the same time, both David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou made the movie for me and would not have enjoyed it without them. I also found it hard to keep in mind that this is something that actually happened 2011 (and should have been big enough for me to hear about it.. but it seems those kind of news don't reach my small country). On the one hand, that factual element makes this an impressive story to tell once you are done watching. But by that same effect, the movie FEELs too much on rails from the start and there are little surprises or memorable moments. Doesn't feel like they had to change or enhance much, as it is all very realistic and safe, and most drama is a checkbox that needed to be ticked.

10,imdb,arabnikita,8.0,"8 / 10 Didn't expect it to be this good Gran Turismo (2023) Racing games are probably my least favorite because I get enough road rage in real life. However I do enjoy an occasional well made racing film like Ford vs Ferrari or Rush. Even though Gran Turismo is a highly popular video game, or racing simulator, this film is NOT a video game adaptation because quite frankly there isn't much to adapt. Instead, it's simply an underdog story that involves a video game and the impact that it had on real life events, kind of like what the film Tetris was. However, this one is quite an unreal story and the entire time I couldn't believe that these events actually occurred. The movie is about an expert Gran Turismo player named Jann. He is considered to be the failure of the family as all he does is play video games but one day, he receives an invitation to participate in an online race. The winner of the race will get chance to compete for a spot to become an actual racer for team Nissan. Sitting with a controller is quite different from being behind an actual wheel of a 300 km/h car and soon enough Jann and other competitors will realize what they signed up for. I know some people have been criticizing the start of the film but for me, it was one enjoyable experience that kept getting progressively better. Yes, it doesn't reinvent the sports drama genre but it takes on an intriguing true story and executes it well. The video game inserts looked good and the actual racing scenes very exciting to watch. David Harbour put on an impactful performance of an inspiring aged mentor who gradually passed down his wisdom to the young and inexperienced protagonist. From the negatives, the editing looked slightly weird at times but it didn't take away from the experience as the action and drama scenes hit home. The fast paced story kept me excited the entire time and I remember holding my breath more than once. Whether you enjoy good underdog stories, play racing games or like cars in general, you are going to have a good time in the cinema.

10,imdb,malz-13196,5.0,"5 / 10 Gran Turismo: A Predictable Ride Through Unrealistic Scenarios and Forced Narratives Remarkably predictable yet somehow still watchable. Unfortunately, it falls into the realm of complete unreality, characterised by a noticeable effort to impress that results in an odd casting choice. The production feels rushed, lacking the depth needed to engage viewers genuinely. While attempting to establish a connection with the characters, the film falls short in authenticity, at times bordering on the absurd. The narrative introduces a protagonist seemingly catapulted from a lifetime of bedroom isolation to sudden stardom and a near-death experience. Strangely, the parents, initially deeply invested in their child's life and future, inexplicably shift to mere onlookers via television, neglecting any personal visits until unrealistically late. A similar forced storyline unfolds with the girlfriend, contributing to the overall lack of sincerity. In performances by Bloom and Hounsou, one can't help but notice a decline in their usual high standards, and Halliwell might find more success in retirement. The film evokes a sense of those storyline videos often skipped in video games-perhaps a deliberate choice. However, despite its potential, it remains firmly in the category of a children's movie that could have been significantly improved with more thoughtful execution.",2023-11-02,0,0,204,0.802,positive,0.852,
10,imdb,Abdulxoxo,7.0,"7 / 10 Revved Up but Predictable Gran Turismo delivers exactly what you'd expect from a movie about racing-fast cars, intense action, and a whole lot of adrenaline. If you're a fan of racing or just love a good underdog story, you're in for a treat. The film is packed with high-octane sequences that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, and the sound design really makes you feel the roar of the engines. Performance-wise, the cast does a solid job. David Harbour stands out, bringing a gruff charm to his role as the seasoned mentor, while Archie Madekwe captures the youthful determination of a gamer turned racer. However, as entertaining as Gran Turismo is, it doesn't exactly break new ground. The storyline is pretty predictable-if you've seen one ""based on a true story"" sports drama, you've likely seen most of what this film has to offer. The beats are familiar: the initial struggle, the montage of improvement, and the final, triumphant race. While this formula works, it does leave you wishing for a few more surprises along the way. Despite its predictability, Gran Turismo is still a fun ride, especially if you don't mind knowing where the road will take you. It's not the most original film out there, but it's well-crafted, enjoyable, and hits all the right notes for a sports drama.",2024-08-19,0,0,225,0.9957,positive,0.743,

It's a lengthy film but the time flys, it's quite a staggering story in reality given they all were Sim Drivers.... The acting isn't the best but the story itself is great and.the film moves along at a good pace with superb actions scenes.
